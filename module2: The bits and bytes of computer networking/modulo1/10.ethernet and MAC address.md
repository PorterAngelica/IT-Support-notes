# üåê Ethernet and MAC Addresses

---

## üì∂ Wired vs Wireless

- Wireless and cellular Internet are common, but **wired Ethernet networks** are still the most used in workplaces and data centers.  
- Ethernet is the primary protocol for sending data across individual links.

---

## üß© Purpose of the Data Link Layer

- Abstracts the physical hardware details from higher layers.  
- Allows software (like web browsers) to send and receive data without worrying about whether the connection is wired or wireless.

---

## üï∞Ô∏è A Bit of History

- Ethernet originated in **1980**, standardized in **1983**.  
- Originally, networks had **collision domains** where only one device could send data at a time.

---

## ‚ö° Collision Domain and CSMA/CD

- Devices shared a collision domain causing data collisions if they sent data simultaneously.  
- Ethernet uses **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) to avoid collisions:  
  - Devices listen before sending data.  
  - If collision detected, devices stop and retry after a random wait.

---

## üÜî MAC Addresses

- **Media Access Control (MAC) Address**: Unique hardware identifier for network interfaces.  
- It's a 48-bit number, shown as six groups of two hexadecimal digits (called **octets**).  
- Hexadecimal digits include numbers 0-9 and letters A-F (representing 10-15).  
- Total possible MAC addresses: 2‚Å¥‚Å∏ ‚âà 281 trillion+ unique addresses.

---

## üè≠ MAC Address Structure

- First 3 octets: **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)** ‚Äî assigned to hardware manufacturers by the IEEE.  
- Last 3 octets: Assigned by manufacturers uniquely per device.

---

## üì° Why MAC Addresses Matter

- Ensure each Ethernet transmission has:  
  - Source MAC address (sender)  
  - Destination MAC address (receiver)  
- Even in a shared collision domain, devices know if the data is meant for them.

---

## üîë Summary

- MAC addresses help identify devices uniquely on a local network.  
- CSMA/CD manages how devices share the network medium to avoid collisions.

## üìö Introduction

Although wireless internet (Wi-Fi and cellular) is very common, **traditional wired networks using Ethernet remain the most prevalent in workplaces and data centers**. Understanding Ethernet and how MAC addresses work is essential for any IT support specialist.

## 1. What is Ethernet? üñß

- **Ethernet** is a protocol used to send data across individual network links (physical cables or connections).  
- It operates at the **Data Link Layer** of the TCP/IP model.  
- Ethernet abstracts the physical hardware (cables, switches, etc.) so higher layers don't have to worry about how data is sent.  
- For example, your web browser does not need to know if it‚Äôs connected via twisted pair cable or wireless ‚Äî it relies on the underlying layers to send/receive data.

### Brief History

- Created in 1980 and standardized in 1983.  
- Early networks used hubs, and all devices shared a **collision domain**, where only one device could transmit at a time.  
- Ethernet solved this problem and continues to be improved today.

---

## 2. Collision Domain and CSMA/CD ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Collision domain:** A network segment where only one device can talk at a time.  
- When two devices transmit simultaneously, a collision occurs and data becomes corrupted.  
- **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):**  
  - Method used to detect if the channel is free before sending data.  
  - If collision is detected, devices stop transmitting and wait a random amount of time before retrying.  
  - This reduces repeated collisions and improves network efficiency.

---

## 3. MAC Addresses (Media Access Control) üéØ

- Each network device has a **unique MAC address** to identify it on the local network.  
- MAC address is a 48-bit number usually written as 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits, e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.  
- It consists of:  
  - **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier):** First 3 octets (24 bits), assigned to manufacturers by IEEE.  
  - **Unique identifier:** Last 3 octets assigned by the manufacturer to ensure uniqueness.  
- There are 2^48 (~281 trillion) possible MAC addresses, making them globally unique.

---

## 4. Types of MAC Addresses üì¨

- **Unicast:** Address that points to a single device.  
- **Multicast:** Address for a group of devices.  
- **Broadcast:** Address that sends data to all devices on the network (e.g., `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`).

---

## 5. Structure of an Ethernet Frame üì¶

- Data sent via Ethernet is packaged into units called **frames**.  
- Main components:  
  - **Destination MAC address**  
  - **Source MAC address**  
  - **Payload (data)**  
  - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):** Used to detect errors in transmission.

---

## 6. Data Integrity Verification: CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) ‚úÖ

- CRC is a calculated value that helps detect errors in transmitted data.  
- The receiver calculates the CRC and compares it to the sender‚Äôs CRC to ensure data integrity.  
- If there is a mismatch, the frame is discarded and retransmission may be requested.

---

## 7. Why is Understanding Ethernet and MAC Addresses Important? ü§î

- To diagnose and troubleshoot network issues (e.g., connection loss, collisions, communication errors).  
- To configure network devices like switches and routers.  
- To identify devices and control network access (e.g., MAC filtering).  
- To understand how network traffic flows and how data moves.

---

## Practical Examples üí°

- If a switch receives a frame with an unknown destination MAC address, it floods the frame to all ports (broadcast).  
- When a device joins a network, its MAC address is used for identifying and managing traffic on that network.
