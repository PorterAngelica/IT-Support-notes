# üîå Cables in Networking

---

## Overview

Lots of different cables and network devices can be used to allow computers to properly communicate with each other. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to identify and describe various networking cables and networking devices. Computer networking is a huge part of the day-to-day role of many IT specialists, and knowing how to differentiate different network devices will be essential to your success.

## üßµ What are Cables?

Cables are the most basic component of a wired network. They connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them.

## üßë‚Äçüîß Types of Network Cables

### 1. Copper Cables

- **Description:**  
  Made up of multiple pairs of copper wires inside a plastic insulator.
  
- **How They Work:**  
  Computers communicate in binary (ones and zeros). The sending device changes voltage between two ranges to represent binary data. The receiver interprets these voltage changes as ones and zeros.
  
- **Common Types:**  
  - Cat 5  
  - Cat 5e  
  - Cat 6  
  
- **Differences:**  
  These categories differ mainly in the number of twists per wire pair, affecting usable length and data transfer rates.
  
- **Details:**  
  - Cat 5 is older and mostly replaced by Cat 5e and Cat 6.  
  - Cat 5e reduces **crosstalk** ‚Äî interference where an electrical pulse from one wire is accidentally detected by another, causing errors.  
  - Cat 6 cables have stricter specs to avoid crosstalk, are faster and more reliable but have shorter max distance at high speeds.

### 2. Fiber Optic Cables

- **Description:**  
  Contain individual optical fibers ‚Äî tiny glass tubes about the width of a human hair.
  
- **How They Work:**  
  Use pulses of light (instead of electrical voltages) to represent binary data.
  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Immune to electromagnetic interference (common in environments with heavy electronic noise).  
  - Can transport data faster and over much longer distances than copper cables.  
  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - More expensive  
  - Fragile  
  
- **Usage:**  
  Fiber cables are more common in data centers than in typical office or home environments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Concepts

- **Crosstalk:**  
  When a signal from one wire interferes with another, causing data errors. Reduced by cable design improvements (Cat 5e, Cat 6).
  
- **Voltage Changes vs Light Pulses:**  
  Copper cables send electrical signals; fiber cables use light, which can travel further and is less prone to interference.

## Summary

Understanding the different types of cables helps IT specialists choose the right cabling for network environments, ensuring reliable and efficient communication between devices.
