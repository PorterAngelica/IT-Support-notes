# 🔌 Network Ports and Patch Panels

---

## 🔌 Network Cable Termination

- Twisted pair cables end with a plug exposing the internal wires.  
- The most common plug: **RJ-45 (Registered Jack 45)**.  
- RJ-45 plugs connect to **RJ-45 network ports**.

## 🖥️ Network Ports on Devices

- Network ports are attached directly to network devices.  
- **Switches**: Have many ports to connect multiple devices.  
- **Servers and desktops**: Usually have 1 or 2 ports.  
- **Laptops, tablets, phones**: Usually no RJ-45 ports.

## 💡 Port LEDs (Lights)

- Most network ports have two small LEDs:  
  - **Link light**: Lit when the cable is properly connected and devices are powered on.  
  - **Activity light**: Flashes when data is being transmitted.  
- Sometimes a single LED indicates both link and activity or even link speed.  
- LED behavior can help troubleshooting.

## 🧱 Patch Panels

- Network ports are sometimes mounted in walls or desks.  
- These ports connect to a **patch panel** — a device with many network ports.  
- Patch panels do **no processing**, just serve as connection points.  
- Cables from patch panels run to switches or routers to provide network access.

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

- Understanding ports and patch panels is essential for troubleshooting and managing physical network infrastructure.
