**Five layer model**  
Model explaining network communication via Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, and Application layers.

**Frame check sequence**  
A 32-bit checksum for the entire frame.

**Full duplex**  
Devices communicate simultaneously in both directions.

**Half-duplex**  
Communication possible in both directions, but only one device transmits at a time.

**Hexadecimal**  
Number representation using base 16.

**Hub**  
Physical layer device that broadcasts data to all connected computers.

**Internet Protocol (IP)**  
The most common protocol at the network layer.

**Internet Service Provider (ISP)**  
Company providing internet connections.

**Internetwork**  
Collection of interconnected networks via routers (e.g., the Internet).

**Line coding**  
Modulation method used in computer networks.

**Local Area Network (LAN)**  
A single network connecting multiple devices.

**MAC (Media Access Control) address**  
A unique 48-bit identifier for a network interface, displayed as six pairs of hexadecimal numbers.

**Modulation**  
Varying voltage on copper cable to transmit data.

**Multicast frame**  
A frame sent to multiple devices on a local network, recognized when the least significant bit in the first octet of the destination address is 1.

**Network layer**  
Allows communication between different networks via routers.

**Network port**  
Physical connector to connect devices to a network (on devices, walls, or patch panels).

**Network switch**  
Data link (Layer 2) device that directs data only to the intended recipient device.

**Node**  
Any device connected to a network acting as client or server.

**Octet**  
A group of 8 bits.

**Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**  
The first three octets of a MAC address.

**OSI model**  
A seven-layer model describing network communication: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

**Patch panel**  
Device containing multiple physical network ports.

**Payload**  
The actual data being transported (everything except headers).

**Physical layer**  
The hardware and physical connections in a network.

**Preamble**  
The first 8 bytes (64 bits) of an Ethernet frame, indicating frame start.
