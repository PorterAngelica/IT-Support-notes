# Study Guide: Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast

---

## 1. Unicast ðŸŽ¯

- **Definition:** Communication from one device to exactly one other device.  
- At the Ethernet level, unicast frames are identified by a special bit in the destination MAC address.  
- If the **least significant bit (LSB) of the first octet in the destination MAC address is 0**, the frame is unicast.  
- The frame is sent to **all devices on the network segment (collision domain)**, but **only the device with the matching MAC address processes it**.  
- Example: Sending data from your PC to a printer on the network.

## 2. Multicast ðŸ“¡

- **Definition:** Communication from one device to a specific group of devices.  
- If the **LSB of the first octet in the destination MAC address is 1**, the frame is multicast.  
- Multicast frames are sent to all devices on the local network segment, but devices decide whether to accept or discard the frame based on configured multicast group membership.  
- Devices can be configured to listen to specific multicast addresses.  
- Use cases: Streaming video to multiple users, group communications in business networks.

## 3. Broadcast ðŸ“¢

- **Definition:** Communication from one device to **all devices** on the local network segment.  
- Broadcast frames use a special destination MAC address known as the **broadcast address**, which is **all Fâ€™s** in hexadecimal (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).  
- Broadcast is used when a device needs to send data to all other devices on the LAN, often for discovery or address resolution.  
- Example: ARP requests to find the MAC address associated with an IP.

## Summary Table

| Type      | Description                      | MAC Address Characteristic                      | Delivery Target           |
|-----------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Unicast   | One device to one device         | LSB of first octet = 0                          | Specific single device    |
| Multicast | One device to a group of devices | LSB of first octet = 1                          | Devices subscribed to group |
| Broadcast | One device to all devices        | MAC address = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (all Fâ€™s)      | All devices on LAN       |

## Why it Matters

- Understanding these three types of transmissions helps in **network troubleshooting** and **traffic management**.  
- Itâ€™s important to know how traffic is sent and who receives it to optimize network performance and security.
