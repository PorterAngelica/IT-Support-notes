## 🏠 Routers vs Hubs and Switches

- **Hubs** and **Switches** connect computers within a single network, called a **LAN** (Local Area Network).  
- To send or receive data between different networks, we use **routers**.

---

## 🔍 What is a Router?

- **Layer:** Network Layer (Layer 3)  
- **Function:** Forwards data between independent networks by inspecting IP data.  
- Unlike hubs (Layer 1) and switches (Layer 2), routers make routing decisions based on IP addresses.

## 🗂️ Routing Tables

- Routers store internal **routing tables** to know how to direct traffic between many networks worldwide.  
- **Home or Small Office Routers:**  
  - Have simple routing tables.  
  - Mainly forward traffic between the local network and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).  
- **Core ISP Routers:**  
  - Handle much larger traffic volumes.  
  - Connect to many other routers.  
  - Manage complex routing decisions.

## 🔄 Routing Protocols

- Routers communicate using protocols like **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**.  
- BGP helps routers learn the best paths to forward data across the internet.
- Border Gateway protocol(BGP) - routers share data with each other via this protocol, ehich lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.

## 🌍 The Internet and Routers

- When you load a webpage, data travels through **dozens of routers** before reaching your device.  
- Routers are the **global guides** that ensure traffic gets to the right destinations across the vast and complex Internet.

## Summary

Routers are essential for directing data between different networks, making sure information reaches the correct location beyond your local network.
