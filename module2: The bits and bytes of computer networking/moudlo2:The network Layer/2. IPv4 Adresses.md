# üåê IPv4 Addresses ‚Äì Study Guide

## üìñ Overview
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is one of the core addressing systems used in networking. It provides a way to uniquely identify devices and networks across the Internet. Understanding IPv4 is crucial for network design, troubleshooting, and administration.

## üßÆ IPv4 Address Structure

- **Length:** 32 bits  
- **Format:** Divided into **4 octets** (each octet = 8 bits)  
- **Notation:** **Dotted Decimal Notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)  
- **Value Range per Octet:** `0` to `255`  
  - Example of a valid IP: `12.34.56.78`  
  - Example of an invalid IP: `123.456.789.100` ‚ùå (values exceed 255)

> üí° **Octet definition:** 8 bits of data, capable of representing 256 unique values (0‚Äì255).

## üó∫ Hierarchical Allocation

Unlike MAC addresses (assigned by hardware vendors), **IPv4 addresses are allocated to organizations and companies** in large blocks.  
This allows IPs to be **hierarchical** and **easier to route**.

**Example:**
- IBM owns every IPv4 address where the **first octet = 9**.
- If a router needs to deliver `9.0.0.1`, it only needs to forward it to **IBM's network routers**.  
  IBM‚Äôs routers will then handle the **final delivery**.

## üîÑ IP Address Ownership

- **IP addresses belong to networks, not devices.**
- Your **MAC address** is permanent for your device.  
- Your **IP address changes** depending on the network you connect to.
  - Example:  
    - At home ‚Üí one IP  
    - At a caf√© ‚Üí different IP

Each local network (LAN) is responsible for assigning IPs to devices that join it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è IP Assignment Methods

### 1. **Dynamic IP Address**
- Assigned automatically when a device joins a network.
- Uses **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**.
- Common for:
  - Laptops
  - Smartphones
  - Most client devices
- Advantages:
  - Easy setup
  - Automatic configuration
- Disadvantages:
  - IP changes over time

### 2. **Static IP Address**
- Manually configured on the device.
- Often used for:
  - Servers
  - Network devices (routers, switches)
  - Critical infrastructure
- Advantages:
  - Consistent address
  - Useful for hosting services
- Disadvantages:
  - Requires manual management

## üß© Key Takeaways

- IPv4 addresses = **32-bit numbers split into 4 octets**.
- **Valid range:** Each octet 0‚Äì255.
- Allocation is **hierarchical**, making routing more efficient.
- **IP addresses belong to networks** ‚Üí same device may have different IPs on different networks.
- **DHCP** = automatic (dynamic) assignment.
- **Static IP** = manual assignment, mostly for servers.

‚úÖ **Pro Tip:** Memorize that `0‚Äì255` is the valid range per octet. Any number above 255 instantly means the IP is invalid.
