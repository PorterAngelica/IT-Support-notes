# IPv4 Address Classes - Full Study Guide ðŸ“š

## Overview
IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers divided into four octets. To organize the huge global IP address space, IPv4 addresses are split into **address classes**. These classes define how many bits are used for the **network ID** and how many for the **host ID** within the address. Understanding address classes helps to know how networks are sized and structured.

---

## IP Address Structure: Network ID and Host ID
- **Network ID:** Identifies the specific network.
- **Host ID:** Identifies a device (host) on that network.

For example, IP address `9.100.100.100`:
- Network ID = `9` (first octet)
- Host ID = `100.100.100` (last three octets)

## Address Classes
There are **five IPv4 address classes**, but only **Class A, B, and C** are widely used.

| Class  | Network ID Bits           | Host ID Bits            | First Octet Range | Number of Hosts per Network  | Purpose                      |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Class A| 8 bits (1st octet)        | 24 bits (last 3 octets) | 0 - 127           | 2^24 - 2 â‰ˆ 16 million        | Very large networks           |
| Class B| 16 bits (first 2 octets)  | 16 bits (last 2 octets) | 128 - 191         | 2^16 - 2 = 65,534            | Medium-sized networks         |
| Class C| 24 bits (first 3 octets)  | 8 bits (last octet)     | 192 - 223         | 2^8 - 2 = 254                | Small networks                |
| Class D| Multicast (no network/host split) | N/A             | 224 - 239         | N/A                          | Multicasting                  |
| Class E| Experimental / Reserved    | N/A                     | 240 - 255         | N/A                          | Reserved for testing/research|

## How to Identify Address Classes by Binary Pattern
- **Class A:** First bit is `0`  
  - Binary starts with `0xxx xxxx`  
  - Decimal first octet: **0 to 127**
- **Class B:** First two bits are `10`  
  - Binary starts with `10xx xxxx`  
  - Decimal first octet: **128 to 191**
- **Class C:** First three bits are `110`  
  - Binary starts with `110x xxxx`  
  - Decimal first octet: **192 to 223**
- **Class D:** First four bits are `1110`  
  - Binary starts with `1110 xxxx`  
  - Decimal first octet: **224 to 239** (used for multicast)
- **Class E:** First four bits are `1111`  
  - Binary starts with `1111 xxxx`  
  - Decimal first octet: **240 to 255** (reserved for testing)

---

## Important Notes
- The **network ID** identifies the network itself, not individual devices.
- The **host ID** identifies individual devices on that network.
- The number of usable host addresses per network is `(2^host_bits) - 2` because:
  - One address is reserved for the **network address**.
  - One address is reserved for the **broadcast address**.
- Classes D and E are special purpose and usually not assigned for typical network devices.

---

## Practical Usage and Modern Context
- The **classful addressing system** is mostly obsolete today.
- It has been largely replaced by **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**, which allows flexible subnetting and more efficient allocation of IP addresses.
- However, understanding address classes is still essential for foundational networking knowledge and legacy systems.
