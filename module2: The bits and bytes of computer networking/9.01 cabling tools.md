## Cable Tester
You can use a cable tester to measure integrity for standards compliance.
A cable tester digitally measures cable integrity to verify compliance with cabling standards. It tests parameters such as:

- Attenuation  
- Impedance  
- Noise  
- Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT)  
- Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio (ACR)  
- PowerSum NEXT
