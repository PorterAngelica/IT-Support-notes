# âš¡ Moving Bits Across the Wire

---

## ðŸ”¢ The Physical Layer

- The physical layer is focused on **moving ones and zeros** from one end of a link to the other.  
- Although the underlying math, physics, and electrical engineering are complex, the basics for IT support are approachable.

---

## ðŸ–§ What You Need to Know

- The physical layer consists of devices and methods for transmitting **bits** across networks.  
- A **bit** is the smallest unit of data: either a **1** or a **0**.  
- These bits form the frames and packets used in higher network layers.

---

## ðŸŽµ Real-World Example

- Whether streaming music, sending emails, or using an ATM, you are ultimately sending **ones and zeros** across the physical layer of networks.

---

## ðŸ”Œ Copper Network Cables

- Standard copper cables carry a constant electrical charge.  
- Bits are sent via **modulation** â€” varying the voltage of the electrical charge.  
- This specific modulation for networks is called **line coding**.

---

## ðŸš€ Network Speed

- Modern networks can transmit up to **10 billion bits per second** across a single cable!

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway

- Understanding the physical layer fundamentals helps in troubleshooting and setting up networks effectively.
