# üîÑ Hubs and Switches

## üñ•Ô∏è Overview of Network Devices

Almost every IT specialist will interact with network devices regularly. While cables form point-to-point connections (linking only two devices), these connections alone aren‚Äôt very useful in a world with billions of computers. Network devices like hubs and switches allow many computers to communicate simultaneously.

## üî∏ What is a Hub?

- **Layer:** Physical Layer (Layer 1)  
- **Function:** Connects many devices at once.  
- **How it works:**  
  All devices connected to a hub receive all data transmissions simultaneously. Each device must check if the data is meant for it or ignore it.  
  
- **Problem:**  
  This creates a lot of network noise and a **collision domain** ‚Äî a network segment where only one device can send data at a time. If multiple devices send data simultaneously, electrical signals collide, causing systems to wait before retransmitting.  
  
- **Result:**  
  Slows down communication significantly. Hubs are mostly obsolete today and considered historical artifacts.

## üîπ What is a Switch?

- **Layer:** Data Link Layer (Layer 2)  
- **Also called:** Switching Hub  
  
- **Function:** Like a hub, a switch connects many devices to communicate but more intelligently.  
  
- **How it works:**  
  The switch inspects Ethernet protocol data and identifies the intended recipient device. It forwards the data only to that device, rather than all devices on the network.  
  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Reduces or eliminates collision domains.  
  - Leads to fewer retransmissions and higher overall network throughput.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Concept: Collision Domain

A **collision domain** is a network segment where data collisions occur if multiple devices transmit simultaneously. Hubs share one collision domain for all connected devices, while switches reduce or isolate collision domains by forwarding data selectively.

## Summary

Switches are a fundamental improvement over hubs because they optimize data flow by sending packets only to intended recipients, improving network performance and reducing congestion.
