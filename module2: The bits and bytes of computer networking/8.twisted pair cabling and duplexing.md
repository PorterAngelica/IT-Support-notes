# üîå Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing

---

## üßµ What is Twisted Pair Cable?

- The most common cabling type for connecting computing devices.  
- Features pairs of copper wires twisted together.  
- Twisting helps protect against **electromagnetic interference** and **crosstalk** from neighboring pairs.

---

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Example: Cat6 Cable

- Standard Cat6 cable contains **8 wires** arranged in **4 twisted pairs** inside one jacket.  
- The number of pairs used depends on the transmission technology.

---

## üîÑ Duplex Communication

- Twisted pair cables support **duplex communication** ‚Äî data flows **both directions** simultaneously.  
- Devices communicate at the same time using separate wire pairs. This is called **full duplex**.

---

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Simplex vs Duplex

- **Simplex communication**: Data flows only in one direction (unidirectional).  
- **Duplex communication**: Data flows both directions (bidirectional).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Half Duplex

- If connection issues occur, the network might degrade to **half duplex**.  
- Half duplex means communication can happen both ways but **only one device can send at a time**.

---

## üîë Key Takeaway

- Twisted pair cables are essential for modern networking and support efficient, simultaneous two-way communication.

# Supplemental Reading for Ethernet Over Twisted Pair Technologies

## Ethernet Over Twisted Pair Technologies

This reading covers the importance of Ethernet over twisted pair technologies. Twisted pair Ethernet cable is the most commonly used Ethernet cable in business and home networks.

Internet connection to a building or home is usually delivered through coaxial or fiber-optic cables from an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The connection reaches a gateway modem inside the building or home (often provided by the ISP). The modem passes the internet connection through a twisted pair Ethernet cable to a router or a single computer. The router then uses twisted pair Ethernet cables to distribute wired network connections internally. These network cables are also called CAT cables (e.g., CAT5, CAT6).

Some routers also provide wireless network connections internally. Additionally, Ethernet over twisted pair technologies can supply telephone and television services to businesses and homes.

## Twisted Pair Cables

Originally, telephone and early data cables consisted of two copper wires laid parallel: one for transmitting and one for receiving data. This design suffered from electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), and crosstalk between wires.

Engineering improvements twisted the wire pairs together, reducing noise on the lines.

Twisted pair Ethernet cables are common in LANs because they:

- Provide multiple levels of protection against EMI, RFI, and crosstalk.  
- Offer low-cost options accessible to home users and small businesses due to lower protection levels.  
- Are thin, lightweight, and flexible for easy installation and movement.  
- Have a suitable transmission range for short distances inside buildings and homes.  
- Support transmission of both data and telephone/voice communications.

## UTP, STP, and FTP Ethernet Cables

Twisted pair Ethernet cables contain four pairs of color-coded copper wires, each pair twisted together (one solid, one striped).

There are three main types:

- **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):** Most common and least expensive, provides basic EMI, RFI, and crosstalk protection.  
- **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):** Used where interference is a problem. Features braided aluminum and/or copper shielding around the twisted pairs under the outer jacket.  
- **Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP):** Also used in interference-prone environments. Uses a thin foil shield wrapped around the bundle of twisted pairs under the jacket.

The terms STP and FTP are sometimes used interchangeably. Some cables combine braided and foiled shielding for extra protection. Check manufacturer specifications for exact shielding.

UTP, STP, and FTP cables may also have shielding around each individual twisted pair to reduce crosstalk further. The most protected cables (e.g., Shielded Foiled Twisted Pair - SF/FTP) are used in industrial environments with high EMI/RFI.

## Straight-Through Cable

Also known as patch cables, these are the primary Ethernet cables used in networks.

- Connect computers and routers to hubs and switches.  
- Connect servers to Ethernet switches.

### Identification

Both ends of a straight-through cable have the same color and stripe order on each pin.

Example: If an orange-striped wire is on pin 1 at one end, it must be on pin 1 at the other end.

100Base-T cables (common in home networks) usually do not use blue and brown wires. Gigabit Ethernet may use blue and brown cables for Power over Ethernet (PoE).

### Pin Assignments

- **Computers and routers use:**  
  - Pins 1 & 2: Orange wires (sending data)  
  - Pins 3 & 6: Green wires (receiving data)  

- **Hubs and switches use:**  
  - Pins 1 & 2: Green wires (sending data)  
  - Pins 3 & 6: Orange wires (receiving data)
