# 🔌 Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing

---

## 🧵 What is Twisted Pair Cable?

- The most common cabling type for connecting computing devices.  
- Features pairs of copper wires twisted together.  
- Twisting helps protect against **electromagnetic interference** and **crosstalk** from neighboring pairs.

---

## 🧑‍🔬 Example: Cat6 Cable

- Standard Cat6 cable contains **8 wires** arranged in **4 twisted pairs** inside one jacket.  
- The number of pairs used depends on the transmission technology.

---

## 🔄 Duplex Communication

- Twisted pair cables support **duplex communication** — data flows **both directions** simultaneously.  
- Devices communicate at the same time using separate wire pairs. This is called **full duplex**.

---

## ↔️ Simplex vs Duplex

- **Simplex communication**: Data flows only in one direction (unidirectional).  
- **Duplex communication**: Data flows both directions (bidirectional).

---

## ⚠️ Half Duplex

- If connection issues occur, the network might degrade to **half duplex**.  
- Half duplex means communication can happen both ways but **only one device can send at a time**.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

- Twisted pair cables are essential for modern networking and support efficient, simultaneous two-way communication.
