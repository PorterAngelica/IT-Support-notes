# Study Guide: Dissecting an Ethernet Frame

---

## Overview

- An **Ethernet frame** is a structured unit of data sent over a network link at the data link layer (Layer 2).  
- It encapsulates all the information needed to deliver data from one device to another on a local network.  
- Understanding the structure of an Ethernet frame is essential for IT support and network troubleshooting.

## Ethernet Frame Components

| Field                 | Size           | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Preamble**          | 8 bytes (64 bits) | - First 7 bytes: alternating 1s and 0s used for synchronization and buffering.               |
|                       |                | - Last byte: Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) signals start of actual frame data.                  |
| **Destination MAC**    | 6 bytes (48 bits) | Hardware address of the intended recipient device.                                           |
| **Source MAC**         | 6 bytes (48 bits) | Hardware address of the sending device.                                                     |
| **Ether-Type Field**   | 2 bytes (16 bits) | Identifies the protocol of the encapsulated payload (e.g., IPv4, IPv6).                       |
| **VLAN Header** (optional) | Varies        | Present if the frame is VLAN tagged, indicates a virtual LAN; follows with Ether-Type field.  |
| **Payload (Data)**     | 46 to 1500 bytes | Actual data being transported from higher layers (e.g., IP, TCP/UDP, application data).       |
| **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)** | 4 bytes (32 bits) | Contains a checksum calculated using Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) for data integrity.    |

## Important Concepts

### 1. **Preamble & SFD**  
- Synchronizes sending and receiving devices so they can properly interpret the start of a frame.

### 2. **MAC Addresses**  
- Both destination and source MAC addresses are essential to ensure frames reach the correct devices.

### 3. **Ether-Type Field**  
- Indicates what protocol the payload contains so the receiving device knows how to process it.

### 4. **VLAN Tagging**  
- Allows multiple logical LANs to exist on a single physical network, segregating traffic by VLAN tags.

### 5. **Payload**  
- Contains the actual message or data from higher layers (IP, TCP/UDP, applications).

### 6. **Frame Check Sequence (FCS) & CRC**  
- The CRC is a mathematical checksum ensuring data integrity.  
- The sender calculates CRC on the frame and appends it as FCS.  
- The receiver recalculates CRC; if it doesn't match the FCS, the frame is discarded due to data corruption.  
- Ethernet only detects errors, does not perform recovery; retransmission is handled by higher layer protocols.

## Why It Matters

- Knowing Ethernet frame structure is key to diagnosing network problems.  
- Understanding CRC and FCS helps explain why some frames get dropped or need retransmission.  
- VLAN awareness is critical for modern network segmentation and security.
