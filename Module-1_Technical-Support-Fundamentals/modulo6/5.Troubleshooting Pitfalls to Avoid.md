## 1️⃣ Pitfall: Going Into Autopilot 🤖

### ❌ What It Looks Like
- Repeating the same fix without analyzing the current case.  
- Skipping **questions** because “I’ve seen this before.”  
- Acting on **assumptions** instead of facts.

### 💡 Why It’s a Problem
Small changes in the situation can **completely alter** the cause of the issue.  
What worked last time might make things worse this time.

### ✅ How to Avoid It
- Always **ask questions** 🗣️ and **gather data** before acting.  
- Verify **symptoms** instead of assuming.  
- Remember: Taking a few minutes to confirm is faster than **redoing sloppy work**.

## 2️⃣ Pitfall: Not Finding the Root Cause 🌱

### ❌ What It Looks Like
- Fixing **surface issues** without addressing the deeper cause.  
- Getting distracted by small errors while ignoring the **big picture**.  
- Using “nuclear” solutions like wiping a system instead of targeted fixes.

### 💡 Why It’s a Problem
- The main problem remains unsolved, so **issues return**.  
- You **lose learning opportunities** that come from fully investigating.

### 🛠 Example
- **User complaint:** Can’t access a particular website.  
- **Bad fix:** Wiping and reinstalling the OS (time-consuming, unnecessary).  
- **Better fix:** Methodically test possible causes (DNS issue, firewall rule, site outage) and fix the **specific** root cause.

### ✅ How to Avoid It
- Use **incremental testing** to narrow down the real issue.  
- Apply the **root cause mindset**: “What is the main thing causing these symptoms?”  
- Take time to fix **the cause**, not just **the effects**.
