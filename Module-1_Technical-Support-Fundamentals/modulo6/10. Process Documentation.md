## üö´ The Worst Documentation: None at All

**Scenario:**  
- You encounter a strange issue that takes hours to resolve.  
- You do **not** write down the solution.  
- A colleague later faces the same problem, spends the same hours troubleshooting, and also doesn‚Äôt document it.  
- This cycle repeats indefinitely.  

**Impact:**  
- Time wasted for both staff and users.  
- Preventable delays in resolving recurring issues.  
- No shared knowledge base for the team.  

**Key Point:** Even minimal documentation is better than nothing ‚Äî it creates a foundation for others to build on.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example of Poor Documentation

**Characteristics:**
- Problem description is **vague**.  
- Leaves the reader with more questions than answers.  
- States *what* will fix an issue but not *how* to do it.  
- Missing detailed steps or specific context.  

> *Example of Bad Documentation:*  
> "Restart the system to fix the issue."  
> *(But which system? Where is it located? How do you restart it? What settings might need checking?)*

**Why it‚Äôs bad:**  
- Lacks specificity.  
- Assumes prior knowledge the reader may not have.  
- Leads to confusion and potential mistakes.

## üåü Example of Good Documentation

**Characteristics:**
1. **Specific and Clear Problem Statement**  
   - Exactly what the issue is.  
   - Includes relevant background details.  
2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**  
   - Clear navigation paths (menus, settings, buttons).  
   - Logical order of actions.  
3. **No Ambiguity**  
   - The reader shouldn‚Äôt have to guess or interpret unclear directions.

> *Example of Good Documentation:*  
> **Problem:** ‚ÄúUsers cannot connect to the Wi-Fi network `CompanyNet` on Windows 10 after password changes.‚Äù  
> **Background:** This occurs because cached credentials are not updated automatically.  
> **Steps to Fix:**  
> 1. Open **Control Panel** ‚Üí **Network and Internet** ‚Üí **Network and Sharing Center**.  
> 2. Click **Manage Wireless Networks** on the left panel.  
> 3. Select `CompanyNet` and click **Remove**.  
> 4. Reconnect to `CompanyNet` and enter the updated password.
