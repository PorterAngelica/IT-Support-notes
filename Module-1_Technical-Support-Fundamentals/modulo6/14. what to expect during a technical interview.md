---

## Overview

When interviewing for a technical role, expect one or more interviews focused on demonstrating your technical skills and knowledge. These interviews often involve:

- **Technical troubleshooting scenarios**
- **Explanations of technical concepts**

The goal is to assess your problem-solving ability and understanding of fundamental IT concepts.

## Key Points to Keep in Mind

### 1. Solid Foundation of Fundamentals 📚

- Be prepared to discuss basic technical topics clearly.
- Interviewers may test the limits of your knowledge.
- It's **normal to not know every answer**.

### 2. Handling Unknown Answers 🤔

- Avoid simply saying “I don’t know.”
- Instead, explain how you **would find the answer**.
- Example: If you don’t know the solution, describe the steps you’d take to research or troubleshoot.

### 3. Problem-Solving Strategies 🧩

- Employers value your **approach to problem solving** more than knowing all answers.
- For complex questions:
  - Outline your approach first.
  - Break down the work into manageable steps.
  - Share your thought process **out loud** to keep the interviewer engaged.
  
### 4. Think Aloud Technique 💭

- Explaining your reasoning helps:
  - The interviewer follow your thought process.
  - You organize your own ideas.
- Example: When stuck on a troubleshooting problem, summarize what you know, what you can rule out, and what info is missing.

### 5. Be Ready to Explain Concepts and Choices 📖

- When mentioning technical terms (e.g., **DNS**), be ready to:
  - Explain what it is.
  - Clarify why it might relate to the problem.
- Justify your decisions or preferred solutions.

### 6. Clarify the Problem and Ask Questions ❓

- Don’t assume anything about the problem.
- Ask follow-up questions to:
  - Confirm the problem’s context.
  - Narrow down the root cause.
- Example questions to ask:
  - What operating system is the user on?
  - How is their device connected to the network?
  - What error messages are showing?
  - Are other users affected?

### 7. Use Evidence and Data to Guide Next Steps 📊

- Base your troubleshooting steps on:
  - Information from the interviewer.
  - Evidence gathered from the scenario.
- This helps avoid unnecessary or wrong steps.

### 8. Use Notes and Diagrams When Appropriate 📝

- For complex issues, taking notes or drawing diagrams can help:
  - Organize your thoughts.
  - Make your explanation clearer.
- However, you don’t need to write everything down all the time—only when it aids understanding.

## Example Scenario Breakdown

Imagine you’re asked to troubleshoot a user unable to connect to an internal system:

1. **Ask clarifying questions:**
   - What OS is the user on? (Windows, Mac, Linux?)
   - How should their computer connect? (Wired, Wi-Fi, VPN?)
   - What error messages are displayed?
   - Are other users experiencing the same issue?

2. **Outline your approach:**
   - Check physical connectivity.
   - Verify network settings (IP, DNS).
   - Confirm user permissions.
   - Test access from another device.

3. **Explain your reasoning aloud:**
   - “I want to rule out network connectivity first because if the user isn’t connected to the network, that explains the problem.”
   - “Next, I’ll check DNS settings since incorrect DNS could prevent access to internal servers.”

## Final Tips for Technical Interviews

- Stay calm and confident.
- Practice thinking out loud during mock interviews.
- Focus on explaining your problem-solving process clearly.
- Don’t fear admitting when you’re unsure—demonstrate how you’d find the solution.
- Use your foundational knowledge and build on it as questions become more challenging.
