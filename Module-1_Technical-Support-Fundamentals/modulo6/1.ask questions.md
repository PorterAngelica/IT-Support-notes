# ❓ Ask Questions! – The First Step in Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting isn’t just about knowing technical details — it’s about asking the **right questions** to understand a problem before trying to fix it.

## 🧠 Why Asking Questions Matters

Imagine someone asks:  
> "How long will it take me to get to the bank?"

Before answering, you’d ask:
- 📍 Where are you?
- 🏦 Where is the bank?
- 🚶‍♂️🚗🚴 Are you walking, driving, or biking?

If you guessed without asking, your answer would likely be wrong. The same applies to IT troubleshooting.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Basics

**Troubleshooting** = Diagnosing and resolving a problem.  
It’s not just for IT — we troubleshoot in daily life:
- 🚗 Car won’t start
- 💡 Light bulb burned out
- 🤒 Feeling sick

A good troubleshooter **gathers information first** instead of jumping to solutions.

## 🚫 Bad Example vs ✅ Good Example

| Scenario | Approach | Outcome |
|----------|----------|---------|
| ❌ **Bad** | User: "My computer’s broken." <br> IT: "Looks bad. You’ll need a new computer. $1,000." | Wrong assumption, unnecessary expense. |
| ✅ **Good** | User: "My computer’s broken." <br> IT: "Can you tell me more? Does it turn on? Any recent damage?" <br> User: "It makes a ding sound but nothing on screen." <br> IT: *Finds brightness was turned down* | Quick, simple fix. |

## 🔍 Key Questions to Ask Before Fixing

1. **When** did the problem start?
2. **What** were you doing before it happened?
3. **Has** it happened before?
4. **Any** recent changes (updates, damage, new software)?
5. **Can** you reproduce the issue?
