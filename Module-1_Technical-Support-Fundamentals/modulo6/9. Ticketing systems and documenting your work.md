## üï∞Ô∏è Why Document Your Work?

- IT tasks often involve many detailed steps.  
- Without documentation, you risk forgetting procedures and repeating work unnecessarily.  
- Documentation might seem time-consuming but actually **saves time** in the long run.  

> *Example:*  
> You troubleshoot a complex issue today. Three months later, the same problem occurs, but you forgot the steps you took. If you documented your solution, you save hours.

## üé´ What Are Ticketing and Bug Systems?

- **Tickets** document user-reported issues or service requests.  
- **Bugs** are problems within the system not caused by users.  
- Tracking issues via tickets/bugs is essential for organization and scalability.  
- Without these systems, tracking problems through emails or chats becomes chaotic.  

### Popular Ticketing/Bug Systems:

- Update the ticket with:  
  - The issue description.  
  - The steps and procedures you tried to fix it.  
  - The final solution.
