# 📝 Documenting in Ticketing Systems

Now that we’ve talked a little bit about documenting processes, let’s move into **writing documentation in ticketing or bug systems**.  
You **don’t need to create a full process doc for every single ticket** you handle.  
If the same issue appears repeatedly, write the documentation **once** and simply **refer back to it** in future tickets.

## 🔍 Why Documentation in Tickets Matters

One of the **most important aspects** of documenting in a ticket or bug system is **leaving an audit trail**.  
This allows others (or future you) to **see what worked and what didn’t**.  
Without this, troubleshooting becomes guesswork.

## 🚫 Example of Bad Documentation

> *“Fixed the issue.”*

**Why this is bad:**
- We don’t know **what the issue was**  
- We don’t know **what caused it**  
- We don’t know **what was done to fix it**  

If another tech encounters the same problem later, this ticket would be **useless**.

## ✅ Example of Good Documentation

> **Issue:** User was unable to access shared network drive.  
> **Cause:** Incorrect permissions were assigned after a recent role change.  
> **Resolution Steps:**  
> 1. Verified user’s account in Active Directory.  
> 2. Identified missing group membership.  
> 3. Added user to correct security group.  
> 4. Confirmed user regained access to the drive.

**Why this works:**
- Describes the **issue clearly**  
- Explains **what caused it**  
- Lists the **exact steps taken** to resolve it  
- Provides a reference for **future similar cases**

## 💡 Best Practices for Ticket Documentation

- **Be clear and specific** — Avoid vague statements.  
- **Record causes and solutions** — Help others (and yourself) later.  
- **List exact steps** — So the process can be repeated.  
- **Link to existing documentation** — Don’t rewrite everything.  
- **Keep it professional** — Tickets are permanent records.

## 🏆 Key Takeaways

- Not every ticket needs a full write-up — **reuse documentation when possible**.  
- Always leave an **audit trail** so anyone can follow what happened.  
- Good documentation should **tell the full story**:  
  **Problem → Cause → Solution**.
