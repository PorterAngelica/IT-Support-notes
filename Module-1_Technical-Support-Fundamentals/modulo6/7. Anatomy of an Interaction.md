## 👋 Starting the Interaction: The Importance of First Impressions

- How you say "Hello" sets the tone.  
- Introduce yourself by name.  
- Use a positive tone and correct spelling/grammar.  
- Incorporate information you know about the user in the greeting.  

> *Example:*  
> - “Hi, Gail. How are you doing?”  
> - User: “Not great. It's been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed.”  
> - Support: “What's wrong with your phone?”  

First impressions matter because they influence how the rest of the interaction goes. You don’t need to be overly enthusiastic, just professional, respectful, and acknowledge the user.

## 🤝 Building Rapport and Acknowledging Feelings

Once you start the interaction, it's important to show you care:

- **Acknowledge the user's feelings.** If they say they're having a bad day, say something like:  
  *"Sorry to hear that. Let’s see what we can do to turn that around."*  
- **Demonstrate a genuine desire to help.** This starts building a relationship based on trust.  
- **Prioritize the user’s current issue.** Even if you have 100 other tickets, this one is the only thing that matters to the user right now. Show them it’s your priority too.  
- **Stay engaged throughout the interaction**; your consistent attention helps keep rapport strong.

> *Example interaction:*  
> - “Hi, Gail. How are you today?”  
> - “Not great. It’s been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed.”  
> - “Sorry to hear that. Let’s see what we can do to turn that around.”  

By acknowledging feelings and demonstrating a desire to help, you start building a relationship.

## 📋 Prioritize the User’s Issue

Even if you have many other tickets, show the user that their issue is your priority.

## 🗣️ Responding to User Questions and Communicating Effectively

Users often have questions while you troubleshoot. How you handle them affects the interaction:

- **Don’t brush off or ignore questions.** This damages rapport and frustrates the user.  
- **Integrate the information users provide into your responses show active listening.** This shows you’re actively listening and care about their situation.  
- When users ask many questions, be transparent:  
  *"I'd be happy to answer all your questions, but I want to look up this one first. I've written them all down so I won’t forget."*  
- **Make sure to actually write down the user’s questions!** Forgetting them can frustrate users and break trust.

> *Example greetings to compare:*  
> | Greeting 1                                     | Greeting 2                                                                                      |  
> |-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
> | "Hi, Rhori. How are you today? What can I help you with?" | "Hi, Rhori. I hope you're having a good day despite your computer randomly turning off. Let's see what we can do to fix your issue." |  

Greeting 2 shows personalization and active listening, which builds rapport better.

## 💬 Handling Questions During Troubleshooting

If the user asks many questions while you are troubleshooting, do one of the following:

1. Ignore them (not recommended).  
2. Pause and say:  
   *"I'd be happy to answer all your questions, but I want to look up this one first. I've written them all down though, so I won't forget them."*  

**Remember:** Actually write down the questions to answer later.

---

## 🐱 Using Small Talk to Build Rapport (Optional)
If a user shares personal facts (e.g., they love cats), you can use this to build connection:

- Ask about their cat later during waiting times, like:  
  *"Do you have any cats? What’s your cat’s name?"*  
- This should feel natural and never forced. If small talk isn’t your style, it’s okay to skip it.

> *Example:*  
> - User mentions loving cats.  
> - Later, you might ask while waiting: “Do you have any cats? What’s your cat’s name?”  

This should never be forced. Skip small talk if it’s not natural for you.

---

## 🔍 Clarifying the Issue Before Troubleshooting
Before jumping into fixing things, **clarify exactly what the problem is**:

- Don’t assume the issue based on initial descriptions.  
- Asking clear, detailed questions helps avoid wasted time.  
- For example, a user says their computer "can't get online," but after troubleshooting IP and DNS you find the machine *is* online but just can’t access one page.  
- Clarifying this early would save 20 minutes for you and the user.

> *Example:*  
> - User says: “My computer can't get online.”  
> - You check IP, DNS, ping—everything looks fine.  
> - Later find out: The machine *is* online but can’t access a specific page.  

If clarified upfront, you could have saved 20 minutes for both.

## 💬 Example Clarification Dialogue

| Support Agent (Leon)                          | User (Ling Chan)                      | Notes                                               |  
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| "Thank you for calling. This is Leon. How can I help you?" | "My computer isn't working."          | Opening the conversation                            |  
| "What do you mean by 'computer isn't working'?" | "It won’t connect to the internet." | Asking for specifics                                |  
| "Do you have the corporate wifi password?"   | "No, why do I need that?"            | Checking prerequisites                              |  
| "To connect to wifi in the building, you need that password." | "I'm not in the building. I'm at a café." | Context changes troubleshooting approach            |  
| "That's odd. Your computer seems different than what we normally use. Can I get your name so I can look up your configuration?" | "Ling Chan."                        | Collecting user info                                |  
| "Do you work at this company?"                | "No, my friend gave me the number." | Revealing user is not an authorized employee       |  

Understanding context like location changes your approach completely.

## 🛠️ Problem-Solving and Questioning Techniques

- You’re not expected to know all answers immediately but should know where to look.  
- Users might feel embarrassed asking for help.  
- Avoid overwhelming users with rapid-fire questions.  
- Always explain why you need to ask questions:  
  *"In order for me to figure out what's really going on, I need to ask you some questions."*  
- When helping in person, always ask before touching devices.  
- When supporting remotely, explain why users need to run commands.  You don’t need to give too much detail, but without context you risk losing their trust. 
- Listen closely; small details can be clues.

---
## 👂 Listening Carefully

- Pay attention to *everything* the user says; even small details can provide clues.  
- For example, if a user says they are "at a café," this affects what network they can access.  
- Taking notes helps you remember and use this information effectively.

---

## ✅ Ending the Interaction

- The last five minutes set the tone for how the user feels after the call.  
- Even if the problem is fixed, users need to feel confident about the solution.  
- End positively by:  
  - Reiterating what you resolved.  
  - Explaining next steps.  
  - Asking if the user has any other questions.

> *Example closing:*  
> "Your issue is fixed. Do you have any other questions?"
