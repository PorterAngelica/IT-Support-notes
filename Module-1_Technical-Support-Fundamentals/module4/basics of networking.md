# Basics of Networking – Study Guide

This guide breaks down the fundamental concepts of networking explained in the video "Basics of Networking" and expands upon each section for deeper understanding, using analogies, examples, and practical insights. It also includes a glossary of key technical terms.

## 🕸️ What Is the Internet?

Most people think of the internet as a magical place full of cat pictures and online shopping. But in reality, the internet is just a **giant network of interconnected computers** across the world — a kind of **global spider web**.

- **Network**: A group of two or more computers connected to exchange information.
- **Example**: Your phone connected to your Wi-Fi at home = a basic network.

### 🔗 Scale of Networks
- **Home Network**: Devices connected via a router or modem.
- **School/Work Network**: All computers and servers connected together.
- **Internet**: Billions of these smaller networks linked into one massive network.

## 🌐 Internet vs. World Wide Web

Don't confuse these two terms:

- **Internet**: The physical infrastructure — cables, satellites, routers, etc.
- **World Wide Web (WWW)**: The content (websites, media) delivered through browsers.

> Accessing a website like `www.google.com` uses the Web, which is just one way to use the internet. Email, file sharing, and chat apps are other examples.

## 🧠 What Is Networking in IT?

**Networking** = The IT field responsible for designing, building, and managing computer networks.

- Huge career field with certifications, job roles, and academic programs.
- Critical knowledge for anyone working in IT.

## 🌍 How Devices Connect to the Internet

### 🔌 Clients vs Servers

- **Server**: A computer that stores content and "serves" it to others (e.g., Google, Wikipedia).
- **Client**: Devices like your phone or laptop that request information from servers.

### 🏠 ISPs (Internet Service Providers)

- Clients don’t connect directly to the internet. They connect to an ISP (e.g., Comcast, CenturyLink, Telefónica).
- ISPs provide the infrastructure (cables, routers) to connect millions of users.
- ISPs also interconnect with other ISPs to form the global internet.

## 📬 IP Addresses and MAC Addresses

Computers have addresses just like houses. Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address. An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.1.4.3. When we want to access a website, we're actually going to their IP address, like 172.217.6.46. Devices that can connect to a network have another unique identifier called a MAC address. MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device. A sample MAC address can be something like this [82:4f:23:59:47:4]. When you send or receive data through a network, you need to have both an IP and a MAC address.

Let’s use the analogy of sending a letter:

- **IP Address** = House address (where to deliver the data).
  - Format: `172.217.6.46`
- **MAC Address** = Recipient's name (who specifically receives the data).
  - Format: `82:4F:23:59:47:4A`

To send and receive data correctly, devices must have both an IP and a MAC address.

## ✈️ How Data Travels (Mail Delivery Analogy)

Imagine sending a letter from New York to Tokyo:

1. You write the recipient's name and address (like MAC and IP).
2. You drop it at the local post office.
3. The mail system routes it through several locations (e.g., Texas, San Francisco).
4. Eventually, it’s placed on a plane and reaches Tokyo.
5. The local postman delivers it to the correct recipient.

> This is how data gets routed on the internet: by passing through multiple networks and routers that forward it closer to its destination.

## 📦 What Are Packets?

Data (like pictures, emails, or text) is **broken into packets** when sent over the internet.

- Each packet is a small piece of the whole message.
- All packets are reassembled upon arrival.
- They are made up of 1s and 0s — binary code.

> Think of a packet like a small envelope containing part of the full message.

## 🧪 Real Example: Natalie and Google

1. Natalie’s computer has IP: `113.8.81.2`
2. She wants to visit `google.com` (IP: `172.217.6.46`)
3. Her computer sends a packet to Google asking for access.
4. The packet travels through her ISP and multiple routers.
5. It reaches a Google server.
6. Google replies with a packet containing a webpage — cat pictures included. 🐱

> All this happens in milliseconds, thanks to networking.

## ✅ Next Steps for Deeper Learning

- Use `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS) to view your IP and MAC addresses.
- Use `tracert google.com` or `traceroute google.com` to see how your data travels.
- Research networking models like **TCP/IP**, **OSI Model**, and **DNS**.
- Explore networking tools like Wireshark to see real-time packet data.
