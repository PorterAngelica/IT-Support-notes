# 🧩 Installing the Processor (CPU)

## ⚠️ Static Safety First
- **Electrostatic discharge (ESD)** can destroy components.
- Prevent it by:
  - Touching grounded metal every few minutes.
  - Wearing an **anti-static wristband** clipped to unpainted metal.
- Keep parts in **anti-static bags** until installation.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Prepare the Motherboard and Case
- Confirm **form factor** (e.g., ATX) matches your case.
- Align **screw holes** on motherboard and case.
- Install or use **built-in standoffs** to mount the board securely.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Install the CPU
- Remove CPU from anti-static bag with care.
- Match the **corner markers** (triangle/arrow) on CPU and socket.
- Insert CPU gently into socket.
- Lock it into place — **use slight pressure** if needed.

---

## ❄️ Step 3: Apply Thermal Paste
- Purpose: Improve heat transfer between CPU and heat sink.
- Apply a **small dab** in the center of the CPU.
- Spread **evenly** with a flat tool across the surface.

---

## 🌬️ Step 4: Mount the Heat Sink and Fan
- Align heat sink screws with socket holes.
- **Tighten screws diagonally** (opposite corners first) for even pressure.
- Check all screws for secure contact.

---

## 🔌 Step 5: Connect Fan to Motherboard
- Plug the CPU fan cable (Molex or 4-pin) into the **CPU fan header**.
- Allows **fan speed to be managed** by the system.

---

## ✅ Done!
Your CPU is:
- Installed ✅
- Cooled ✅
- Connected to the motherboard ✅

# 🔧 Installing RAM, SSD, Fan & Power Supply (Full Build Continued)

---

## 💾 Step 1: Install RAM (Memory)

### ✅ Preparation:
- Locate the **DIMM slots** on the motherboard.
- Check the **RAM type** (e.g., DDR3 in this build).
- Ensure the **notch in the RAM** aligns with the slot.

### 📌 Installation Tips:
- Visually align all RAM sticks before inserting.
- Insert the RAM stick firmly until you hear a **click**.
- Both latches should lock into place.
- For dual-channel support, use **same-color slots** (e.g., white only).

---

## 💽 Step 2: Install the Storage Drive (SSD)

### 📦 Type: 
- This build uses a **2.5" SATA SSD**.

### 🔗 How to Install:
1. Slide the SSD into the **drive bay** until it clicks (may vary by case).
2. Use a **SATA data cable**:
   - One end to the **SSD**
   - The other to a **SATA port on the motherboard**
3. SATA cables only go in **one direction** — don’t force them.

---

## 🌬️ Step 3: Install Rear Case Fan

### 💡 Notes:
- Locate the **“Rear Fan” header** on the motherboard (may vary by model).
- Align fan with the rear mount holes.
- Screw it in and connect the **fan connector** to the motherboard.

### 🔄 Best Practice:
- Create a **wind tunnel**:
   - Air comes in through front/bottom
   - Passes over hot components
   - **Exits out the back/top**

- The **CPU heat sink fan** works with the case fans for proper cooling.

---

## ⚡ Step 4: Install the Power Supply (PSU)

### 🧱 Mounting the PSU:
- Slide the **power supply** into the case (typically at the bottom rear).
- **Avoid hitting the motherboard** during installation.
- Push unused cables aside to avoid clutter and damage.

### 🔩 Securing:
- Hand-tighten screws first.
- Then use a screwdriver to **secure the PSU firmly**.

> ⚠️ TIP: In some cases, it may be easier to install the PSU **before** the motherboard, depending on case layout.

---

✅ At this point, your:
- RAM is installed  
- SSD is mounted and connected  
- Rear fan is installed  
- PSU is secured  

You’re almost ready to wire everything up and boot for the first time!

# 🧩 Final Build Steps: Graphics Card, Case Cables, Peripherals & First Boot

---

## ⚡ Step 1: Connect Power Supply to Motherboard

- Plug the **24-pin main connector** into the motherboard.
- Plug the **8-pin (or 4+4) CPU power cable** into the socket near the CPU.
  - Both are essential for powering the system.

---

## 🎛️ Step 2: Connect Case Cables (Front Panel)

- Attach the **case I/O cables** (power button, reset button, HDD LED, power LED).
- Placement varies by motherboard model — check the **motherboard manual or label**.
- Optional: Use included **cable guides or clips** to keep everything tidy.

---

## 🎮 Step 3: Install the Graphics Card (GPU)

- Insert the **graphics card** into the **PCIe x16 slot** on the motherboard.
- Apply **gentle but firm pressure** until it clicks into place.
- Secure the card to the case using screws (location may vary by case).
- If your GPU requires external power, plug in the **6/8-pin PCIe power cables** from the PSU.

---

## 🖥️ Step 4: Attach the Side Panel

- Detach your **anti-static bracelet**.
- Place and secure the **side panel** on your case.
- Now your build is physically complete!

---

## 🔌 Step 5: Connect Peripherals

- Plug in the **keyboard and mouse** into USB ports.
- Connect the **monitor** to the GPU using:
  - **DisplayPort** (used in this example)
  - Or HDMI, DVI, VGA depending on your monitor/GPU

---

## 🚀 Step 6: First Boot Test

- Press the **power button**:
  - Look for **power indicator lights** or **fan movement**.
  - Check if the **monitor receives a signal**.

> ✅ If everything is connected correctly, you’ll see a boot screen or system message.

---

## 🧱 Common First Boot Issue: No OS

- You may see an error like:
-Non-system disk or disk error.
-Replace and strike any key when ready.

- This means there's **no operating system installed yet** — totally normal!
- Next step: **install an operating system**, which will be covered in the next lesson.
