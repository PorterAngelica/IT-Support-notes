# üß† CPU Lesson: Instruction Sets, CPU Compatibility, and Architecture

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) handles this for you.  
It is, in fact, a very powerful calculator that constantly processes binary information millions or even billions of times per second.

## üìö Instruction Sets: The CPU‚Äôs ‚ÄúTranslation Book‚Äù

The CPU doesn‚Äôt randomly figure out what to do with the binary‚Äîit uses a set of predefined instructions, called an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).  
Think of this as:  
- A translator‚Äôs handbook for binary  
- A library of operations the CPU is hard-coded to perform  

Each CPU is built to understand and execute a specific set of operations, like:  
- Add  
- Subtract  
- Move data  
- Copy data  
- Compare values  
- Jump to a different instruction  

üí° Every complex program‚Äîfrom video games to Microsoft Excel‚Äîis broken down into tiny, simple commands from this instruction set that the CPU can understand.

## üè≠ Instruction Sets Depend on CPU Manufacturers

CPUs are manufactured by different companies. The most popular ones are:  
- Intel  
- AMD  
- Qualcomm  
- Apple (Apple Silicon)  

Each company might use a slightly different instruction set. For example:  
- Intel and AMD use x86 and x86-64 (aka x64)  
- Apple and Qualcomm use ARM-based instruction sets  

Even though the instructions might be structured differently internally, the end goal is the same: perform core functions to run software.

## üîß CPU Product Names and Brands

Here are some product names you might encounter:  
- Intel: Core i3, i5, i7, i9, Pentium  
- AMD: Ryzen, Athlon, Threadripper  
- Qualcomm: Snapdragon series (used mostly in mobile devices)  
- Apple: A8, M1, M2, etc. (used in iPhones and Macs)  

When working in IT, you don‚Äôt just need to recognize the brand, you also need to understand what performance level and compatibility each model offers.

## üîå Compatibility: CPUs and Motherboards Must Match

You can‚Äôt just mix and match any CPU with any motherboard.  
Why?  
Because different CPUs:  
- Have different physical shapes and pin layouts  
- Use different socket types  
- Require different chipsets to function properly  

Two main socket types:  
| Socket Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| LGA (Land Grid Array) | Pins are on the motherboard; CPU has flat contact points; used by Intel CPUs |
| PGA (Pin Grid Array) | Pins are on the CPU; motherboard has holes in the socket; used by many AMD CPUs |

üí° Always check:  
- The CPU socket type (e.g., LGA1151, AM4, etc.)  
- The supported chipset  
- Whether BIOS updates are needed for newer CPUs  

This information is printed on the box or listed on the manufacturer‚Äôs website.

## üå°Ô∏è Cooling the CPU: Avoid Overheating

CPUs generate heat‚Äîa lot of it‚Äîespecially under heavy workloads.  
To prevent overheating:  
- You must install a heat sink  
- Pair it with a fan or liquid cooling system  
- Apply thermal paste between the CPU and heat sink to improve heat transfer  

üö® Overheating = crashing, performance issues, or permanent damage.

## üìè CPU Architecture: 32-bit vs 64-bit

Every CPU follows a bit architecture, most commonly:  
- 32-bit  
- 64-bit  

This determines how much data the CPU can process at once and how much RAM it can access.

| Architecture | Max RAM Access | Data Width | Common Today? |
|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| 32-bit       | ~4 GB         | 32 bits    | Rare         |
| 64-bit       | 18.4 million TB | 64 bits  | Standard     |

üí° Today‚Äôs computers, operating systems, and most software are designed for 64-bit architecture, which is much more powerful.

# üß† Expanded Lesson: RAM (Random Access Memory)

## üîπ What Is RAM?

RAM stands for Random Access Memory.  
It‚Äôs the short-term memory of your computer.  

RAM is volatile, meaning:  
- When your computer powers off, everything stored in RAM is wiped out.  
- RAM stores temporary data that your CPU needs fast access to, like:  
  - Programs that are currently running.  
  - Files you're working on.  
  - System processes and background tasks.

## üî∏ Why Is RAM Important?

Your computer copies programs into RAM before running them.  
This way, the CPU can access them much faster than if they were left on the hard drive.  

More RAM = you can run more programs at the same time without slowing down.  

Example:  
If your computer has 16GB of RAM, it can load and manage up to 16GB of active programs (Chrome tabs, Word, games, etc.) before it starts slowing down or crashing.

## üî∏ What Happens When Power Is Lost?

If you're typing a document and the power goes out:  
Data in RAM is gone unless you saved it to your hard drive.  

Same with video games: if you didn‚Äôt save, all unsaved progress stored in RAM is lost.

## üß™ Types of RAM

1. **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**  
Most commonly found in modern computers.  
Stores each bit of data in a microscopic capacitor:  
- Charged = 1  
- Discharged = 0  
These capacitors sit on small chips mounted to RAM sticks.

2. **SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)**  
Works in sync with the system clock.  
Faster than older DRAM because it processes instructions in rhythm with the CPU.

3. **DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)**  
Current industry standard.  
Transfers data twice per clock cycle, making it significantly faster.

### üåÄ Versions of DDR:

| Version | Speed   | Power Usage | Notes               |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| DDR1    | Slowest | High        | Legacy              |
| DDR2    | Faster  | Lower       |                     |
| DDR3    | Even faster | Even lower | Still used in older systems |
| DDR4    | Fastest | Lowest      | Current standard for new PCs |

DDR4 is the best for speed, efficiency, and capacity.  
Faster RAM = better performance and multitasking.

## üß© RAM Form Factors

RAM chips are mounted on memory sticks (modules).  
Common form: DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module)  
Has pins that connect it to the motherboard.

Different types of RAM use different pin layouts, so:  
‚ö†Ô∏è You must match your RAM type to your motherboard.

## üîß Compatibility Tips

Just like with CPUs, not all RAM sticks fit all motherboards.  
Things to check:  
- Is it DDR3 or DDR4? (Motherboards only support one type)  
- Is the pin configuration correct?  
- Is your motherboard slot compatible?  

If you try to force the wrong RAM type, it won‚Äôt fit ‚Äî or worse, you could damage your hardware.

## üí° Summary

- RAM stores temporary, fast-access data.  
- It‚Äôs volatile, so it gets erased when power is lost.  
- Common RAM types: DRAM, SDRAM, and DDR SDRAM (DDR4 being the newest).  
- Faster RAM = faster and smoother computing.  
- Always ensure your RAM and motherboard are compatible.

# üß© Expanded Lesson: The Motherboard ‚Äî The Backbone of Your Computer

## üîπ What is a Motherboard?

The motherboard is the main circuit board inside your computer.  
It‚Äôs like the foundation that holds all parts together.  

It connects and allows communication between:  
- CPU (processor)  
- RAM (memory)  
- Storage devices (hard drives, SSDs)  
- Peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor)  
- Expansion cards (graphics cards, sound cards, network cards)  

It also routes power from the power supply to all components.

## üî∏ Key Characteristics of Motherboards

1. **Chipset**  
The chipset controls how data flows between components.  
It consists of two main chips:  
- **Northbridge:** Connects high-speed components like RAM and video cards.  
- **Southbridge:** Manages slower I/O controllers like hard drives and USB devices.  

*Note:* In modern systems, the Northbridge functions are often integrated directly into the CPU.

2. **Expansion Slots**  
Slots on the motherboard where you can install expansion cards to add functionality.  
Common example: Adding or upgrading a graphics card.  

The current standard for these slots is PCI Express (PCIe).  
PCIe slots come in different sizes (x1, x4, x8, x16) depending on bandwidth.  
Expansion cards are small circuit boards that fit into these slots.

3. **Form Factor**  
Motherboards come in different sizes and shapes, called form factors.  
Form factor affects:  
- How many components can fit  
- The size of the case you need  
- Types and number of expansion slots  

Common form factors:  
- **ATX (Advanced Technology Extended):** Full-sized boards, common in desktops.  
- **ITX (Information Technology Extended):** Smaller boards for compact builds.  
Variations include Mini ITX, Nano ITX, and Pico ITX.  

Choose form factor based on your needs:  
- Small builds = smaller form factor (fewer expansion options)  
- Workstations or gaming rigs = full-sized ATX for maximum expandability

## üîπ Why Does This Matter?

Compatibility is crucial when upgrading or repairing.  
For example:  
- A replacement graphics card might not fit if the motherboard uses a smaller form factor or different PCIe slot ‚Äî wasting time and money.  
- RAM modules and CPU sockets must match the motherboard type.  
- Knowing your motherboard helps avoid costly mistakes, especially in IT support scenarios.

## üî∏ Summary

| Component       | Function                     | Notes                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Chipset         | Controls data flow between components | Northbridge (RAM, GPU), Southbridge (I/O) |
| Expansion Slots | Add cards to increase functionality | PCI Express is the standard today |
| Form Factor     | Size and shape of motherboard | ATX (large), Mini ITX and others (smaller) |

- **CPU Socket:** This is where the CPU (processor) fits. It must match the CPU‚Äôs socket type.  
- **RAM Slots:** Place for RAM sticks. Must match RAM type (e.g., DDR4).  
- **PCI Express Slots:** Used for adding expansion cards like graphics cards.  
- **Northbridge Chip:** Manages fast data communication (RAM, GPU).  
- **Southbridge Chip:** Manages slower input/output devices (USB, storage).  
- **Power Connectors:** Connect power from the PSU (Power Supply Unit) to motherboard.

## üí° Real-Life Scenario

If you‚Äôre an IT support technician responding to a ticket for a video problem, check the motherboard specs before buying a new graphics card. Otherwise, you might end up with a card that physically doesn‚Äôt fit the expansion slot ‚Äî wasting time and resources.
# üíæ Computer Storage & Data Units: Bits, Bytes, and Beyond

## What is a Bit?

The bit is the smallest unit of data storage in computing.  
It can only hold one binary digit: either 0 or 1.  
Think of it like a tiny switch that is either off (0) or on (1).

## What is a Byte?

A byte is made up of 8 bits.  
A single byte can store one character, such as:  
- A letter (like ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚Äúz‚Äù)  
- A number (like ‚Äú5‚Äù)  
- A symbol (like ‚Äú$‚Äù or ‚Äú?‚Äù)  

## Bigger Data Units

- **Kilobyte (KB):** About 1,024 bytes (not exactly 1,000 due to binary math).  
- **Megabyte (MB):** 1,024 KB.  
- **Gigabyte (GB):** 1,024 MB.

### Example: How Much Is 500 GB?

An average music file is about 3 MB.  
On a 500 GB hard drive, you could store roughly 165,000 music files.  
That‚Äôs a huge library of music, showing how much data can fit on modern storage.

## Types of Storage Drives: HDD vs SSD

### Hard Disk Drives (HDD)

- HDDs store data on spinning metal disks called platters.  
- A mechanical arm reads and writes data on these platters.  
- Speed depends on how fast the platters spin, measured in RPM (Revolutions Per Minute).  
- Common speeds: 5,400 RPM or 7,200 RPM.  
- Faster RPM means faster read/write speeds.  
- **Pros:** Generally cheaper per GB.  
- **Cons:** More moving parts mean more prone to damage and failure.

### Solid State Drives (SSD)

- SSDs have no moving parts.  
- They store data on microchips, like USB flash drives.  
- Data moves much faster in SSDs compared to HDDs.  
- Form factor (physical size) is smaller and more compact than HDDs.  
- **Pros:** Faster, more durable, less prone to physical damage.  
- **Cons:** More expensive per GB, usually less storage capacity for the price.

### Hybrid Drives

- Some drives combine HDD and SSD features.  
- They use SSD for quick access to frequently used data (like the OS and programs).  
- Use HDD space for bulk storage of files.  
- A good balance of speed and storage size at a moderate price.

## Drive Interfaces: How Drives Connect to Your Computer

### ATA & SATA

- ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment): An older connection standard.  
- SATA (Serial ATA): The modern standard for connecting HDDs and SSDs.  
- Uses a single thin cable for data transfer.  
- Supports hot swapping: you can plug or unplug SATA drives without turning off the computer.  
- Faster and more efficient than older ATA cables.

### NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)

- Created for very fast SSDs.  
- Instead of cables, NVMe drives plug directly into expansion slots on the motherboard.  
- This allows much higher speeds and lower latency.  
- Perfect for the latest, fastest SSDs.

## Summary

| Storage Type | Speed    | Durability                  | Cost per GB | Typical Use               |
|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| HDD          | Moderate | Fragile (moving parts)       | Low         | Large capacity, budget-friendly |
| SSD          | Very fast| Very durable                 | Higher      | Fast boot, quick program access |
| Hybrid (SSD+HDD) | Balanced | Moderate                 | Moderate    | Combination of speed and storage |

## Practical Advice for IT Support

- Always back up data regularly to prevent loss due to drive failure.  
- Understand what type of storage a machine uses before upgrading or troubleshooting.  
- Know the interface type (SATA, NVMe) to ensure compatibility.  
- When upgrading, balance between cost, speed, and storage needs.

| Petabyte  | 1 PB = 10¬π‚Åµ bytes     | 1 PiB = 2‚Åµ‚Å∞ bytes     | Pebibyte   | -12.6%     |
| Exabyte   | 1 EB = 10¬π‚Å∏ bytes     | 1 EiB = 2‚Å∂‚Å∞ bytes     | Exbibyte   | -15.3%     |
| Zettabyte | 1 ZB = 10¬≤¬π bytes     | 1 ZiB = 2‚Å∑‚Å∞ bytes     | Zebibyte   | -18.1%     |
| Yottabyte | 1 YB = 10¬≤‚Å¥ bytes     | 1 YiB = 2‚Å∏‚Å∞ bytes     | Yobibyte   | -20.9%     |

- üìò Decimal values are often used in marketing (hard drives, phones). Binary is more accurate and used in engineering.

### üîç Examples of Storage Capacity

| Size | What It Can Hold (Roughly)                |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 KB | A short text file or small icon (like a .gif) |
| 1 MB | A short novel or 1 min of MP3 music      |
| 1 GB | 300 high-res photos or 2.5‚Äì3 hours of MP3s |
| 1 TB | 200,000 songs or 300 hours of HD video  |
| 1 PB | 1.5 million CD-ROMs or 500 billion text pages |
| 1 EB | 11 million 4K movies or 3,000 Libraries of Congress |
| 1 ZB | 30 billion 4K movies (according to Seagate) |
| 1 YB | Data from 1 million full data centers (estimated) |

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Marketing sizes use decimal (1 KB = 1,000), but engineers use binary (1 KiB = 1,024).  
- The bigger the storage, the bigger the difference between what‚Äôs advertised vs what‚Äôs real.  
- Knowing this helps when you're:  
  - Troubleshooting storage space  
  - Explaining why a 1TB drive doesn‚Äôt show exactly 1,000 GB  
  - Working in IT or engineering  
# üß† Power Supplies & Electricity in Computers ‚Äì Key Concepts

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Why Computers Need Power Supplies

Computers use DC (Direct Current), but electricity from the wall is AC (Alternating Current).  
A Power Supply Unit (PSU) converts AC from the wall into low-voltage DC that the computer can safely use.

## üîå Inside a Power Supply

- **Fan:** Keeps the PSU cool.  
- **Voltage Information Label:** Shows the specs.  
- **Cables:**  
  - Power the motherboard and other components.  
  - Include a main power cable that connects to the wall.

## üßØ Real-Life Dangers of Wrong Voltage

- Plugging a 120V device into a 220V outlet = üî• fried device (too much voltage = too much pressure).  
- Plugging a 220V device into a 120V outlet = weak performance or eventual damage.  
- **üîë Rule:** Always match the device with the correct voltage.

## üö∞ Analogy: Electricity is Like Water

| Water System Part | Electrical Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Water pressure    | Voltage (V) ‚Äì pushes electricity |
| Water flow rate   | Amperage / Current (A) ‚Äì pulls electricity |
| Total water output | Wattage (W) = Volts √ó Amps |

## üîã Amps and Charging

- Amps measure how much current a device can pull.  
- 2.1A charger charges faster than 1A, because it provides more current if the device supports it.

## üîã Wattage (W = V √ó A)

- The total power a system or device needs.  
- If wattage is too low, the system won't function.  
- If wattage is too high, it‚Äôs fine ‚Äì the PSU will only supply what‚Äôs needed.

## üîß Example:

- Basic desktop: ~500W PSU is usually fine.  
- Gaming / video editing PCs: Need higher wattage PSU.

---
# üõ† Diagnosing Power Supply Problems

Common issues from a bad PSU:  
- Computer doesn‚Äôt turn on  
- Random shutdowns or crashes  

PSU failures can happen due to:  
- Burnouts  
- Power surges  
- Lightning strikes  

‚úÖ Every IT Support Specialist should know how to:  
- Diagnose power supply issues  
- Replace faulty power supplies  

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Power Supplies ‚Äì Summary Guide

- Reduces voltage to a safe level for internal components.  
- Part of the hardware layer in computer architecture.  

## üèó Power Supply in Computer Architecture  
Power supplies are essential to support:  
- Motherboard  
- CPU(s)  
- RAM  
- Storage devices  
- Expansion cards  
- Peripherals  

Type and size of the power supply depends on the hardware components in the system.

## üåç Input Voltage Standards by Region

| Region                        | Voltage Standard  |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| North, Central & parts of South America | 110‚Äì127 VAC     |
| Most of the world             | 220‚Äì240 VAC       |

> VAC = Volts of Alternating Current  

Using the wrong voltage can:  
- Undervolt (won‚Äôt run properly).  
- Overvolt (can destroy components).

## üîß Solutions for Voltage Mismatch  
If a computer‚Äôs power supply doesn't match the country‚Äôs voltage:  
- üîÅ Replace the power supply with one for local voltage.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Use a dual-voltage PSU (switch between 110‚Äì120V and 220‚Äì240V).  
- üîå Use an external power converter.

# How Devices Talk to Each Other & Boot Up

## How Input Devices Work (Keyboard, Mouse, etc.)
Devices like keyboards don't have built-in instructions the CPU can use.

So, the system needs device drivers:  
‚û§ Small programs that tell the CPU how to communicate with external devices.

---

## BIOS & UEFI

### BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
- Stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) on the motherboard.
- Initializes hardware and starts the boot process.
- Loads just enough to start the operating system.

### ROM vs RAM

| ROM                | RAM                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Non-volatile (data stays) | Volatile (cleared on power off) |
| Stores BIOS/firmware | Stores temporary working memory for programs |

### UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
- Modern replacement for BIOS.
- Has better security, supports larger hard drives, and has a graphical interface.
- Most new computers use UEFI instead of legacy BIOS.

---

## Boot Process and POST

### Power-On Self Test (POST)
- Runs before BIOS initializes hardware.
- Checks for hardware issues (RAM, CPU, GPU).
- If there's an error:
  - Beep codes are produced (like Morse code).
  - Different motherboard manufacturers have different beep meanings.
  - Example: 1 beep = good, 2 beeps = error (depends on manual).
- Not all systems have internal speakers, so no beep ‚â† broken.

---

## CMOS & BIOS Settings

### CMOS Chip
- Stores BIOS settings: boot order, date/time, hardware configuration.
- Accessed during boot-up by pressing a key (often F2, Del, Esc, or F10).

### Common BIOS Tasks for IT Support:
- Changing boot order (e.g., boot from USB to reinstall OS).
- Resetting BIOS settings.
- Enabling/Disabling devices like virtualization or secure boot.
- Reimaging a computer:
  - Wipe current OS.
  - Install a fresh OS image from USB, CD, or network.
  - Must configure BIOS/UEFI to boot from the correct device.

# Installing The Processor

## Why This Matters in IT Support
As an IT Support Specialist, you‚Äôll often be responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting desktops. Understanding how to install and handle CPUs helps you:  
- Replace or upgrade hardware.  
- Diagnose issues like overheating or boot failures.  
- Build or reimage systems for deployment.

---

## Step 1: Anti-Static Safety ‚Äì Protect the Hardware
**Why?** Static electricity can damage or destroy delicate components.  
Two ways to stay safe:  
- Touch a grounded object (like a plugged-in, powered-off metal computer case) every few minutes.  
- Use an anti-static wrist strap:
  - Clip it to a non-painted metal part of the case.
  - Strap it securely to your wrist.

**Extra Tip:** Keep all parts in their anti-static bags until you‚Äôre ready to install them.

---

## Step 2: Prepare the Motherboard and Case
- Choose compatible parts:
  - Make sure your motherboard form factor (e.g., ATX) fits your case.
  - The CPU must match the motherboard‚Äôs CPU socket type (e.g., LGA 1200).
- Mount the motherboard:
  - Locate the standoff holes in the case.
  - Align them with the motherboard screw holes.
  - Install standoffs if your case doesn‚Äôt already have them.
  - Place the motherboard gently onto the standoffs.

---

## Step 3: Install the CPU
‚ö†Ô∏è CPUs are fragile and expensive ‚Äî handle by the edges!  
- Remove the CPU from the anti-static bag.
- Align the CPU correctly:
  - Look for the gold triangle or marker on one corner of the CPU.
  - Match it with the triangle or notch on the motherboard socket.
  - Do not force it ‚Äî it should slide in gently when aligned.
- Secure the CPU:
  - Close the socket cover and latch.
  - You may need to apply light pressure to lock it in.

**Extra Tip:** Only use CPUs compatible with the exact socket type of your motherboard (e.g., Intel LGA or AMD AM4).

---

## Step 4: Apply Thermal Paste
**Why?** Thermal paste helps transfer heat from the CPU to the heat sink.  
- Put a small dab (about the size of a grain of rice or a small pea) in the center of the CPU.
- Spread evenly using a flat tool:
  - Cover the surface without letting it spill over the edges.
- An even layer improves cooling.

---

## Step 5: Install the Heat Sink
- Place the heat sink carefully over the CPU:
  - Make sure the screws align with the mounting holes.
- Tighten the screws in a cross-pattern:
  - This ensures even pressure and a secure fit.
  - Example: tighten top-left, then bottom-right, then top-right, then bottom-left.
- Double-check tightness:
  - Go over the screws again to make sure they‚Äôre secure.

**Extra Tip:** Many heat sinks come with pre-applied thermal paste. If so, skip Step 4.

---

## Step 6: Connect the CPU Fan
- Locate the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.
- Plug the heat sink fan cable into the header.
- This allows the system to monitor and adjust fan speed automatically.

---

## Final Check: CPU Installed Successfully
You‚Äôve now:  
- Protected your components from static.  
- Installed the CPU with correct alignment and pressure.  
- Applied thermal paste and secured the heat sink.  
- Plugged in the fan for proper cooling control.  
- Your CPU is ready to boot.

# Installing RAM and the Storage Drive

## Installing RAM (Memory)
RAM (Random Access Memory) is the short-term memory of your computer ‚Äî it helps your system run faster and handle more tasks at once.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Installing RAM
1. Locate the DIMM Slots  
   These are the long slots on the motherboard, usually placed near the CPU.  
   DIMM = Dual Inline Memory Module.
2. Check Compatibility  
   RAM must match your motherboard specifications (e.g., DDR3, DDR4, or DDR5).  
   Match the notch in the RAM stick with the key in the slot to avoid incorrect installation.
3. Plan the Placement  
   Use matching slots (e.g., both white slots if color-coded). This enables dual-channel mode for better performance.  
   Gently check all your RAM sticks and align the notch visually before installing to avoid forcing them in.
4. Install the RAM  
   Insert the stick into the slot, pressing firmly down on both ends until you hear a click.  
   The side latches will close around the RAM automatically when it‚Äôs installed correctly.  
   Repeat for all sticks.

**Pro Tip:** Always start with the recommended slots per the motherboard manual (often 2nd and 4th if using 2 sticks).

**Success Check:**  
- Each stick clicks in securely.  
- Both latches snap shut.  
- No visible gap between RAM and motherboard.

## Installing the Drive (SSD or HDD)
SSDs (Solid State Drives) are faster and more reliable than traditional HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). Modern builds use SSDs for the operating system and essential apps.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Installing an SSD
1. Mount the Drive  
   Insert the SSD into the drive cage or bay inside the case.  
   Slide it in until you hear a click or secure it using screws (depends on case design).
2. Connect the SATA Cable  
   Plug one end into the SSD.  
   Plug the other end into a SATA port on the motherboard.  
   SATA ports are usually labeled and located near the bottom right.
3. Connect Power  
   Use a SATA power cable from the power supply.  
   Connect it to the power port on the SSD.

**Pro Tip:** SATA cables only go in one direction. Don‚Äôt force them.

---

## Optional: Installing a Case Fan
Case fans help maintain airflow and cool your components.

### How to Install
- Match the fan screw holes with the case and secure using screws.
- Connect the fan cable to the FAN or CHA_FAN header on the motherboard.

### Airflow Tip
- Position fans to bring cool air in from the front or bottom and push hot air out the back or top.  
- This airflow setup is called a wind tunnel.

---

## Final Step: Install and Secure the Power Supply (PSU)
1. Insert the PSU into the Case  
   Carefully slide the power supply unit into its designated space (usually bottom-back of the case).  
   Keep cables clear of the motherboard to avoid damage.
2. Secure the PSU  
   Use 4 screws to tightly attach the PSU to the case.  
   Start each screw with your fingers, then finish with a screwdriver.
3. Manage Cables  
   Route cables neatly to keep them out of airflow paths and away from fans or the motherboard.

**Optional Note:** Some builders install the PSU before the motherboard, depending on case design.

---

## Install the Graphics Card (GPU)
1. Find the PCIe Slot  
   Typically a long, reinforced slot on the motherboard, often labeled PCIe x16, near the CPU.
2. Insert the GPU  
   Line up the gold connectors with the slot.  
   Push down firmly until you hear a click.  
   The locking latch should snap into place.
3. Secure to Case  
   Use screws to fasten the GPU to the back of the case.  
   Some GPUs also need a 6-pin or 8-pin power connector from the PSU.

**Important:**  
If your monitor is connected to the motherboard video port instead of the GPU, you might not see video!

---

## Close the Case
1. Remove the Anti-Static Bracelet (after everything is connected and secured).
