# Mobile Operating Systems 📱

Some mobile devices are general-purpose computing devices like tablets or smartphones. Other mobile devices like fitness monitors, e-readers, and smartwatches, are designed to do a smaller set of tasks.

## OS Origins and Differences 🧩
- General-purpose mobile devices use mobile operating systems derived from other OSs.
- **Android** is derived from **Linux**.
- **iOS** shares many core components with **MacOS**.

## Power Optimization 🔋
- Mobile devices run on batteries that need regular recharging or replacement.
- Mobile OSs are optimized to use **as little power as possible**.
- They remove OS features and apps that the device doesn't need to save battery life.

## Interaction Methods ✋🎤
- Mobile devices use motion, touch, and voice interactions.
- This requires **device drivers and support** specific to mobile hardware.
- Different from desktop or server computers in interaction design.

## Specialized Mobile Devices 🕹️
- Devices like fitness trackers, e-readers, and GPS devices often use **custom OSs**.
- These OSs are optimized for specific tasks with minimal hardware and battery usage.
- May use specialized chips and peripherals that general OSs don’t support.
