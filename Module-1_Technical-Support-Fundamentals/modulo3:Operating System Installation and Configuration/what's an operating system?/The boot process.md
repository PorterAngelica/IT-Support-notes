# üöÄ The Boot Process: How Your Computer Starts

As an IT support specialist, understanding how a computer starts (or *boots*) is essential‚Äîespecially when troubleshooting machines that won‚Äôt start.

## ü•æ What Does ‚ÄúBoot‚Äù Mean?

The term *boot* comes from the phrase **‚Äúpull oneself up by one‚Äôs bootstraps‚Äù**‚Äîstarting from nothing and going through steps to reach a working system.

## üîë General Steps of the Boot Process

Just like cars start in similar ways (insert key, turn ignition), computers follow a common pattern:

1. **Power On**  
   The moment you press the power button, the system starts.

2. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**  
   This low-level software checks and initializes your hardware, making sure everything is ready.

3. **Power-On Self-Test (POST)**  
   The system runs diagnostic tests to verify hardware functionality.

4. **Boot Device Selection**  
   Based on the BIOS/UEFI configuration, the computer checks devices in a specified order (hard drives, USB drives, CDs, etc.) to find a bootloader.

5. **Bootloader Execution**  
   The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system. Once found, it starts running.

6. **Operating System and Kernel Load**  
   The bootloader loads the OS and the kernel, which manages hardware resources and drivers.

7. **System and User Processes Start**  
   Essential services launch, including user login and the desktop environment, letting you interact with your computer.
