# ‚öôÔ∏è Process Management

One of the most important tasks that the **kernel** performs is **process management**.

---

## üß† What Is a Process?

- A **process** is an instance of a **program** that is currently executing.
  - Example: Your internet browser or text editor while running.
- A **program** is simply an application that can be launched ‚Äî like Chrome.
- You can have **many processes** from the **same program** running at the same time.
  - Example: Multiple Chrome windows = multiple processes of the Chrome program.

## üîÑ Resource Allocation

To run programs, the computer needs to dedicate resources like:

- **RAM** (Memory)
- **CPU** (Processing Power)

Since these resources are limited, the kernel ensures efficient distribution so that multiple programs can operate simultaneously.

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è System Processes

The system is **always** running many processes in the background ‚Äî not just the ones the user launches.  
The kernel must constantly manage **all** of these to keep the system functioning properly.

---

## üîÅ Process Creation

When a program is executed:
1. A **process is created**.
2. The process requires **hardware resources** (CPU & RAM).
3. The **kernel schedules CPU time** to execute instructions in the process.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Slicing

Since there is usually only **one CPU**, how does it handle multiple processes?

- The kernel uses **time slicing**:
  - A **time slice** is a **tiny interval** of CPU time allocated to a process.
  - The CPU executes one process for a few **milliseconds**, then switches to the next.
  - This creates the **illusion of simultaneous execution**, but it‚Äôs actually **rapid switching**.

Example:

```plaintext
Process A ‚Üí [time slice]
Process B ‚Üí [time slice]
Process C ‚Üí [time slice]
...repeat...

```

## ‚ö° This switching happens so quickly that it feels like everything runs at the same time.

---

## üê¢ Why Is My Computer Slow?

If your system is lagging, there may be CPU-related issues, such as:

- A single process using too many time slices  
- Too many processes competing for CPU time  
- Background processes overwhelming system capacity  

In such cases, manual intervention (like killing a process) might be needed.

---

## üßπ Process Termination

The kernel also manages how processes are terminated:

- Frees up system resources previously used  
- Reallocates those resources to other processes  
- Ensures system stability and efficiency

|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process**          | A running instance of a program                                   |
| **Program**          | An application that can be launched (e.g., Chrome)                |
| **Time Slice**       | Small time interval allocated by the CPU to run a process         |
| **Process Scheduler**| Manages the execution order and timing of all processes           |
| **Process Termination** | Releasing used resources and reallocating them              |
