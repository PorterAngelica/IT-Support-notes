# 📓 Logs: Your System’s Diary

Imagine you’re playing your favorite video game and finally reach the big boss.  
You’ve spent hours finding it, ignoring everything else—work, school, even hygiene.  
Just as you’re about to defeat the boss, your console suddenly shuts off.

😱 You panic.

But then you remember you saved your game right before the boss.  
You turn it back on, ready to continue... and it shuts off again.  
This happens repeatedly. Frustrated, you want to know: **What’s wrong?!**

## 🗣️ How Computers "Talk" to Us

Computers don’t whisper their problems, but they do tell us what’s going on — through **logs**.  
Logs are files that record system events like:

- When the computer was turned on  
- When drivers loaded  
- Errors and warnings  

Think of logs as your system’s diary, recording everything that happens.

## 🔍 Why Logs Matter

Logs help us **understand what’s wrong** when something breaks.  
They can tell us:

- What happened just before a crash  
- Which driver failed to load  
- Why a device isn’t responding

## ⚠️ Logs Can Be Tricky

Since the system records almost everything, logs can be long and overwhelming.  
It takes some effort and skill to sift through the noise and find the important clues.

--- 

You won’t need a “voice” from your computer to tell you what’s wrong—you’ll know how to read its story yourself.
