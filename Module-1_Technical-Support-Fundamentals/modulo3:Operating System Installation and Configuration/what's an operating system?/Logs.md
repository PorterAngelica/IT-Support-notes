# 📓 Logs: Your System’s Diary

---

## 🗣️ How Computers "Talk" to Us

Computers don’t whisper their problems, but they do tell us what’s going on — through **logs**.  
Logs are files that record system events like:

- When the computer was turned on  
- When drivers loaded  
- Errors and warnings  

Think of logs as your system’s diary, recording everything that happens.

## 🔍 Why Logs Matter

Logs help us **understand what’s wrong** when something breaks.  
They can tell us:

- What happened just before a crash  
- Which driver failed to load  
- Why a device isn’t responding

## ⚠️ Logs Can Be Tricky

Since the system records almost everything, logs can be long and overwhelming.  
It takes some effort and skill to sift through the noise and find the important clues.

You won’t need a “voice” from your computer to tell you what’s wrong—you’ll know how to read its story yourself.
