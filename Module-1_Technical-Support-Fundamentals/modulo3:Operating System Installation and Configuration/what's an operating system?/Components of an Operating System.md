# Introduction to Operating Systems

A lot of people hear the term **operating system** and think of the interfaces on their desktops or phones ‚Äî the menus, buttons, and backgrounds. Technically, these are part of the operating system, but the concept goes much deeper.

An **operating system** is the complete package that manages a computer‚Äôs resources and allows users to interact with it.

## üîß The Two Main Components of an Operating System

There are two core components of every operating system:

### 1. **The Kernel**
- The **kernel** is the heart of the operating system.
- It communicates directly with the hardware.
- Manages system resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
- Users do **not** interact with the kernel directly.

### 2. **User Space**
- Everything **outside** the kernel.
- This includes:
  - System programs
  - User interfaces
  - Applications we interact with

When we refer to an operating system, we mean both the **kernel** and the **user space**.

## üíª Major Operating Systems in IT

There are hundreds of operating systems, but in IT support, we focus on the following major ones:

### ü™ü Windows OS
- Developed by **Microsoft**
- Widely used in both business and consumer environments
- Most pre-built PCs come with Windows by default
- While "PC" means "Personal Computer," in modern use it's often synonymous with a Windows computer

### üçé macOS
- Developed by **Apple**
- Mostly used in the consumer space
- Pre-installed on Apple computers

### üêß Linux
- **Open-source** operating system
- Free to share, modify, and distribute
- Widely used in:
  - Business infrastructure
  - Consumer devices
- **Linux** is actually a **kernel**, originally developed by **Linus Torvalds**
- Now a massive community-driven effort

#### Linux Distributions
Because Linux is open-source, many organizations build their own versions, called **distributions (distros)**:
- Common distros: **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Red Hat**

## üì± Other Operating Systems

- **Chrome OS** (not covered in depth here) is gaining popularity
- **Mobile OS usage** exceeds desktop usage worldwide
- Fun fact: **Chrome OS** and **Android OS** both run the **Linux kernel** underneath

---

## üîç Why Learn This?

Understanding the building blocks of **one OS** makes it easier to understand **any OS**.

In IT support, you‚Äôll often work with:
- Desktop OSs
- Mobile OSs
- And more...

## üß† Core Functions of the Kernel

Let‚Äôs break down the four major functions the kernel performs:

### 1. **File Management**
- Manages file storage and retrieval
- Comparable to an office file system with folders and cabinets
- Data is stored as files: documents, pictures, music, etc.
- Files are organized using **directories (folders)** to avoid chaos
- Different operating systems use different **file systems** (we‚Äôll explore this in detail later)

### 2. **Process Management**
- Manages execution of multiple programs (processes)
- Controls:
  - Order of execution
  - Resource allocation
  - Runtime duration
- Includes a **process scheduler** that allows multitasking by rapidly switching between processes
- Gives the **illusion of simultaneous actions**

### 3. **Memory Management**
- Optimizes system memory usage
- Ensures applications have enough memory to function
- Prevents memory conflicts between processes

### 4. **Input/Output (I/O) Management**
- Manages communication with external devices:
  - Disks
  - Keyboards
  - Mice
  - Network connections
  - Audio devices
- If you've ever:
  - Saved a file
  - Clicked a mouse
  - Used a microphone during a video call  
  You‚Äôve experienced I/O management in action

## üë§ What Is the User Space?

The **user space** is the layer we interact with directly, and includes:
- Programs (e.g. text editors, media players)
- User interfaces (e.g. desktop environments)
- System settings and controls

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

By now, you should have a basic understanding of:

- What an operating system is
- The two core components: **Kernel** and **User Space**
- Major operating systems in IT
- The kernel‚Äôs core functions:
  - File Management
  - Process Management
  - Memory Management
  - I/O Management
