# Installing Linux 🐧

---

## Introduction  
Now that we've seen how Windows is installed, let's go ahead and install the Linux operating system. Linux comes in many different versions called **distributions**. There are hundreds of them with various pros and cons, but we'll use the most popular consumer distribution: **Ubuntu**.

## Preparing the USB Drive  
I've already loaded Ubuntu on a plain USB drive.

> **Pro tip:**  
> Since Ubuntu is open source, you can download the free OS image directly from their website and install it using any bootable media you like.  
>  
> **Important:** You *can’t just copy* the install file to a USB drive. The USB needs to be made bootable from the BIOS. Use a tool like [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable USB.  

When ready, power on your PC and make sure to set it to boot from the USB device.

## Starting the Installation  
Once Ubuntu loads, you'll get two options:

- **Try Ubuntu first** (runs it live without installing)  
- **Install Ubuntu** (fresh install)

We will choose **Install Ubuntu** for a clean setup.  

You'll see the Ubuntu logo and some loading screens while the system prepares for installation. For now, just accept the defaults.

## Setup Details  
You'll be asked for:

- **Your name**  
- **Computer name / Hostname** — used to identify the computer on a network  
- **Username** — your login name  
- **Password** — to secure your account  

Example:  
**Name:** Cindy  
**Hostname:** Cindy-NYC (industry standard: username-location)  

After filling in the details, click **Next**. The system will install and prompt you to restart when finished.

## Logging In  
After restart, log in using the username and password you created.

## Ubuntu Desktop Overview  
Welcome to the Ubuntu desktop environment! Here's what you see:

- **Left-side Dock:** shortcuts to frequently used apps  
- **Top-right bar:** quick settings for network, Bluetooth, sound, time, power options  

Click the menu and select **System Settings** to adjust things like:

- Screensaver  
- Screen resolution  
- Hardware settings  

---

## File Management  
Back on the desktop, click the **Files** icon to open the file manager. Here you can browse your files and folders.

Clicking **Computer** takes you to the system's root directory (advanced topic for later).

---

## Creating a File Using the Terminal  

1. Open the **Terminal** app (search for "Terminal").  
2. You'll see a command prompt like this:  
   ```bash
   username@hostname:~/Desktop$
This shows the current user, hostname, and directory (Desktop).  
3. To check your shell, type:

    echo $SHELL

It should return:

    /bin/bash

(This means you are using the Bash shell.)  
4. To create a file, use the touch command:

    touch "my super cool file"

This creates a new empty file on your Desktop.  

Why Learn Commands?  
You might wonder:  
Why memorizing Linux shell commands is necessary when using a GUI is easier?  

Answer:  
If you work with Linux machines (especially remotely), knowing commands is essential.  
The terminal offers powerful control that a GUI can’t always provide.
