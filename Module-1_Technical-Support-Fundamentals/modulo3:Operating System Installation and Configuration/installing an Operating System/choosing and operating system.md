# Choosing an Operating System üñ•Ô∏è

In the last lesson, you learned how an operating system boots up. Now, let's walk through the steps to select and install an operating system, especially in an IT context.

## How to Decide Which OS to Install? ‚ùì

- **Has the decision already been made?**  
  Organizations often choose OS based on the applications and systems they need. If a specific OS is required, the decision is done.

- **If no decision yet:**  
  Ask what software needs to run on the device. Some software is OS-specific, others are cross-platform.

- **What hardware will be used?**  
  Modern OS support common hardware well, but some manufacturers restrict OS installation to their hardware only.

- **CPU Architecture Compatibility**  
  Remember 32-bit vs 64-bit CPUs and OS versions.  
  If you have a 64-bit CPU, install the 64-bit OS version.

## Installing the Operating System üíæ

- Many computers come with an OS pre-installed. Booting will continue from vendor's setup point. You‚Äôll finalize setup by configuring:  
  - Computer/host name  
  - Network settings

- For installing OS from scratch, different installation media options:  
  - Disk or USB drives  
  - Internet-based reinstallations

- As an IT support specialist, installing OS multiple times means:  
  - Using one disk is inefficient  
  - Consider scalability for multiple machines

- For now, focus on installing from a USB drive:  
  - Windows manufacturers often provide special USB drives with the installation image  
  - Linux OS can be loaded onto any USB drive
