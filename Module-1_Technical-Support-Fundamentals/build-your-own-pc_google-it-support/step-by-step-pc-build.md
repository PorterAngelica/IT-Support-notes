# üß© Installing the Processor (CPU)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Static Safety First
- **Electrostatic discharge (ESD)** can destroy components.
- Prevent it by:
  - Touching grounded metal every few minutes.
  - Wearing an **anti-static wristband** clipped to unpainted metal.
- Keep parts in **anti-static bags** until installation.

---

## üß± Step 1: Prepare the Motherboard and Case
- Confirm **form factor** (e.g., ATX) matches your case.
- Align **screw holes** on motherboard and case.
- Install or use **built-in standoffs** to mount the board securely.

---

## üß† Step 2: Install the CPU
- Remove CPU from anti-static bag with care.
- Match the **corner markers** (triangle/arrow) on CPU and socket.
- Insert CPU gently into socket.
- Lock it into place ‚Äî **use slight pressure** if needed.

---

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Step 3: Apply Thermal Paste
- Purpose: Improve heat transfer between CPU and heat sink.
- Apply a **small dab** in the center of the CPU.
- Spread **evenly** with a flat tool across the surface.

---

## üå¨Ô∏è Step 4: Mount the Heat Sink and Fan
- Align heat sink screws with socket holes.
- **Tighten screws diagonally** (opposite corners first) for even pressure.
- Check all screws for secure contact.

---

## üîå Step 5: Connect Fan to Motherboard
- Plug the CPU fan cable (Molex or 4-pin) into the **CPU fan header**.
- Allows **fan speed to be managed** by the system.

---

## ‚úÖ Done!
Your CPU is:
- Installed ‚úÖ
- Cooled ‚úÖ
- Connected to the motherboard ‚úÖ

# üîß Installing RAM, SSD, Fan & Power Supply (Full Build Continued)

---

## üíæ Step 1: Install RAM (Memory)

### ‚úÖ Preparation:
- Locate the **DIMM slots** on the motherboard.
- Check the **RAM type** (e.g., DDR3 in this build).
- Ensure the **notch in the RAM** aligns with the slot.

### üìå Installation Tips:
- Visually align all RAM sticks before inserting.
- Insert the RAM stick firmly until you hear a **click**.
- Both latches should lock into place.
- For dual-channel support, use **same-color slots** (e.g., white only).

---

## üíΩ Step 2: Install the Storage Drive (SSD)

### üì¶ Type: 
- This build uses a **2.5" SATA SSD**.

### üîó How to Install:
1. Slide the SSD into the **drive bay** until it clicks (may vary by case).
2. Use a **SATA data cable**:
   - One end to the **SSD**
   - The other to a **SATA port on the motherboard**
3. SATA cables only go in **one direction** ‚Äî don‚Äôt force them.

---

## üå¨Ô∏è Step 3: Install Rear Case Fan

### üí° Notes:
- Locate the **‚ÄúRear Fan‚Äù header** on the motherboard (may vary by model).
- Align fan with the rear mount holes.
- Screw it in and connect the **fan connector** to the motherboard.

### üîÑ Best Practice:
- Create a **wind tunnel**:
   - Air comes in through front/bottom
   - Passes over hot components
   - **Exits out the back/top**

- The **CPU heat sink fan** works with the case fans for proper cooling.

---

## ‚ö° Step 4: Install the Power Supply (PSU)

### üß± Mounting the PSU:
- Slide the **power supply** into the case (typically at the bottom rear).
- **Avoid hitting the motherboard** during installation.
- Push unused cables aside to avoid clutter and damage.

### üî© Securing:
- Hand-tighten screws first.
- Then use a screwdriver to **secure the PSU firmly**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è TIP: In some cases, it may be easier to install the PSU **before** the motherboard, depending on case layout.

---

‚úÖ At this point, your:
- RAM is installed  
- SSD is mounted and connected  
- Rear fan is installed  
- PSU is secured  

You‚Äôre almost ready to wire everything up and boot for the first time!
