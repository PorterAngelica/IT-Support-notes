# 🧩 Installing the Processor (CPU)

## ⚠️ Static Safety First
- **Electrostatic discharge (ESD)** can destroy components.
- Prevent it by:
  - Touching grounded metal every few minutes.
  - Wearing an **anti-static wristband** clipped to unpainted metal.
- Keep parts in **anti-static bags** until installation.

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Prepare the Motherboard and Case
- Confirm **form factor** (e.g., ATX) matches your case.
- Align **screw holes** on motherboard and case.
- Install or use **built-in standoffs** to mount the board securely.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Install the CPU
- Remove CPU from anti-static bag with care.
- Match the **corner markers** (triangle/arrow) on CPU and socket.
- Insert CPU gently into socket.
- Lock it into place — **use slight pressure** if needed.

---

## ❄️ Step 3: Apply Thermal Paste
- Purpose: Improve heat transfer between CPU and heat sink.
- Apply a **small dab** in the center of the CPU.
- Spread **evenly** with a flat tool across the surface.

---

## 🌬️ Step 4: Mount the Heat Sink and Fan
- Align heat sink screws with socket holes.
- **Tighten screws diagonally** (opposite corners first) for even pressure.
- Check all screws for secure contact.

---

## 🔌 Step 5: Connect Fan to Motherboard
- Plug the CPU fan cable (Molex or 4-pin) into the **CPU fan header**.
- Allows **fan speed to be managed** by the system.

## ✅ Done!
Your CPU is:
- Installed ✅
- Cooled ✅
- Connected to the motherboard ✅
