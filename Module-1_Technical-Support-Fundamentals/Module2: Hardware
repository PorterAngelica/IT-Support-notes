## 💻 Introduction to Computers

Computers are all around us: phones, laptops, desktops, ATMs, smart TVs — they’re all computers at their core.

A **computer** is a device that:

- Takes input  
- Processes data  
- Stores information  
- Provides output  

**Key concepts:**
- **Data** = raw information (text, images, sound)
- **Processing** = transforming data into useful info
- **Storage** = saving data for future use

## 🧱 Hardware – The Physical Layer

**Hardware** = physical components you can touch.

### 🔌 Common External Hardware (Peripherals)

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Monitor | Displays visual output (GUI, videos, text) |
| Keyboard | Input device to type commands or data |
| Mouse | Pointing device for GUI |
| Webcam | Captures video |
| Speakers | Sound output device |
| Printer | Converts digital documents to paper |

---

## 🔗 Ports and Connectivity

**Ports** = connection interfaces for peripherals.

### 🔌 Common Port Types

| Port | Function |
|------|----------|
| USB | Connects peripherals (keyboard, printer, etc.) |
| HDMI/VGA/DP | Video output |
| Ethernet | Wired network connection |
| Audio Jacks | Sound input/output |
| Power Port | Connects to power source |

## 🧩 Internal Components

### 🧠 CPU (Central Processing Unit)

- The "brain" of the computer  
- Executes instructions, performs calculations  
- Measured in **GHz** and **cores/threads**

### 💾 RAM (Random Access Memory)

- Temporary memory for active tasks  
- **Volatile** (data erased when powered off)

| RAM Size | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| 4 GB | Basic tasks |
| 8 GB | Multitasking |
| 16+ GB | Gaming, editing |

### 💽 Storage (HDD / SSD)

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| HDD | Cheaper, large capacity | Slower, mechanical |
| SSD | Faster, silent | More expensive |

### 🧠 Motherboard

- Main circuit board  
- Hosts CPU, RAM, ports, and BIOS

### ⚡ Power Supply Unit (PSU)

- Converts AC to DC power  
- Feeds all components with proper voltage

## 🧳 Miniature Computers

- **Laptops** = same components, smaller form
- **Smartphones** = use ARM CPUs, compact storage/RAM

---

## 👨‍🔧 Why Hardware Knowledge Matters

- Troubleshooting hardware issues
- Replacing or upgrading components
- Communicating with users
- Diagnosing problems effectively

> 🛠️ IT Support = technicians or doctors for computers.
