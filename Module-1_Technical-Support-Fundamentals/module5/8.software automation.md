## 🧰 Automation Tools

There are many tools and systems that help manage computers efficiently through automation.

Examples:
- Scripts (e.g., Bash, Python)
- Configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef)
- Deployment systems (e.g., Jenkins, CI/CD pipelines)

## 📜 Example: Using a Script to Troubleshoot

Instead of reading **hundreds of lines of log files** manually, you could write a script that:

- Scans the log file
- Searches for specific error keywords
- Prints only the relevant lines

```bash
#!/bin/bash
grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog
```

This saves time and avoids human error.
