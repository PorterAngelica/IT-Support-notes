# 🧰 Installing, Updating, and Removing Software on Windows

## 🔧 Installing Software: Git Example

### 📌 What is Git?

- Git is a **version control system** used to track changes in files and directories.
- It’s especially useful in programming, much like how word processors let you view revision history.

### 🛠 Steps to Install Git on Windows

1. **Download the Installer**
   - Visit [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Download the **64-bit executable (.exe)** file.
     - This matches our system’s **64-bit CPU architecture**.
     - Using the correct version ensures better compatibility and performance.

2. **Run the Executable**
   - The file has a `.exe` extension — this is a **Windows executable file**.
   - Double-click the `.exe` file to start the installation process.
   - Windows may prompt you for confirmation to install.

3. **Complete the Setup**
   - Follow the installation wizard instructions.
   - In some cases, you may need to **restart the system** to complete the installation properly.

4. **Verify Installation**
   - Go to `Add or Remove Programs` in the Windows settings.
   - Look for **Git version x.x.x** in the list of installed applications.

## 🔁 Updating Installed Software

If you already have an older version of Git installed:

- **Download the latest version** from the official site.
- Run the installer as before.
- The setup wizard will detect the existing version and prompt you to **upgrade**.
- Follow the prompts — it's a seamless update.

🧠 **Note**: You don’t need to uninstall the old version manually — just reinstall to update.

## 🗑️ Removing Software from Windows

To uninstall an application like Git:

1. **Open Settings**

3. **Uninstall**
   - Click on the application.
   - Select the **Uninstall** button.

4. **Administrator Access**
   - You may be prompted for an **administrator password**.
   - This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized changes.

5. **Restart Your Computer**
   - After uninstalling, a restart ensures the system can **clean up residual files** and finalize removal.

## ⚠️ Key Security Note

Windows requires administrator permissions to install or remove software. This ensures:
- Only authorized users make changes
- Prevents installation of **malware** or unapproved apps
- Helps maintain **system integrity** in shared or enterprise environments
