# ðŸ§  Revisiting Abstraction

Earlier in this course, we talked about how **programs** are sets of instructions that are given to a **CPU**. These instructions can be sent in the form of **binary code (bits)**, and the CPU will use an **instruction set** to execute them.

However, **CPUs come from different manufacturers** and may use **different instruction sets**. On top of that, computers often include a wide variety of **hardware components** â€” such as video cards, hard drives, and network adapters â€” each with their own specialized interfaces and communication methods.

So the question becomes:

> **How can we write a program that all hardware can understand?**

## ðŸ”€ The Hardware Compatibility Problem

One possible approach would be to:
- Write a **unique program** for each combination of CPU and hardware.
- Use the **native languages** and **interfaces** of each component.

But that would be **impractical** â€” there are **millions of possible hardware configurations**. Creating a custom software solution for each setup would be overwhelming, inefficient, and unscalable.

## ðŸ§© The Solution: Abstraction

Thanks to the efforts of computer scientists, we donâ€™t have to deal with low-level hardware intricacies when writing software. Thatâ€™s because we rely on the principle of **abstraction**.

### ðŸ§± What is Abstraction?

Abstraction allows us to:
- **Hide complex implementation details**.
- Focus on **higher-level logic**.
- **Write programs** using standard programming languages that can run on **any hardware**.

Instead of needing to know exactly how a specific CPU or hardware component works, developers write instructions in a **high-level programming language**. These instructions are then **translated** (via compilers, interpreters, or virtual machines) into low-level instructions that the hardware can understand.

## âœ… Key Takeaway

Without abstraction, we would need to manually tailor software to every unique hardware setup â€” a nearly impossible task. Abstraction is what **bridges the gap between software and hardware**, and itâ€™s what makes modern computing practical, scalable, and accessible.
