# 🧩 Types of Software

When you create original content — whether it's writing, art, or engineering — your work is protected by copyright. The same applies to **software**. Copyright laws help developers control how their software is used and distributed.

## 🏷️ Software Licensing

- **Commercial software** typically requires users to pay for a license in order to use it.
- **Open source software** is free to use, modify, and share. Developers grant access to the code so that others can collaborate and improve it.

### 🔓 Open Source Examples
- **Linux Kernel** – Used in Android OS, servers, personal computers, and more
- **LibreOffice**
- **GIMP**
- **Firefox**

These projects are often maintained by communities of **volunteer developers**, demonstrating the power of collaborative software development.

> ⚠️ In an IT environment, always check the license agreement of any software before installing it. You may need to pay for multiple licenses or ensure compliance with open-source guidelines.

## 🔢 Understanding Software Versions

Software version numbers indicate the progress or updates of a program. Most versions follow a **sequential numbering pattern**, like:

- `1.2.5`
- `1.3.4`

Between the two, **1.3.4** is the newer version.

> Developers may use different conventions, but generally, higher numbers indicate more recent releases with newer features or fixes.
