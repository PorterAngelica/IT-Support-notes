# 💻 How Software Is Built: Coding, Scripting, and Programming

Software is everywhere — from video games and music players to web browsers and mobile apps. But how is it actually **built**, and what do terms like **coding**, **scripting**, and **programming** really mean?

---

## 🧩 What Is Software?

Software refers to a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. It's what powers:

- 📱 Mobile apps
- 🎮 Games
- 🌐 Internet browsers
- 🎵 Music players
- 🧑‍💼 Business applications

We interact with software every day, but understanding how it's made is key — especially if you work in IT.

## 🧠 Coding vs. Scripting vs. Programming

These three terms are often used interchangeably, but each has subtle distinctions:

### 🧾 Coding
> **Definition:** Translating one set of instructions or language into another — often from a human language (like English) into a computer language.

- Example: Writing HTML or Python code
- When building an application, this process is called “coding an app”

### 📜 Scripting
> **Definition:** Writing code in a **scripting language** to automate a task or perform a specific function.

- Scripts are typically short and focused
- Examples: Bash, Python, JavaScript (for quick automation or tasks)

> Scripts are often used in **system administration**, automation, or light web tasks.

### 🧱 Programming
> **Definition:** Writing instructions in a **programming language** to build full-scale software.

- Involves more structure, complexity, and components
- Used for building entire applications (browsers, games, media players)
- Examples: Java, C++, C#, Python

> Programming is more likely to involve software engineering principles like architecture, testing, and deployment.

## 🛠️ What Is Software Made Of?

Software is made up of **code**, which is written using:

- 🧑‍💻 Programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- 📜 Scripting languages (e.g., Bash, JavaScript, Perl)

Anyone who knows these languages can **write software** — and there’s **huge demand** for this skill today.

> 📌 Software is not "magically" connected to the Internet — developers **build in** that connectivity during development.

---

## 🌍 Software & Internet Integration

Most modern software is built to **work with the Internet**. For example:

- Social media apps rely on remote servers and APIs
- Messaging apps send data across networks
- Games connect players worldwide

> This integration is written directly into the code — it’s not something added later.

## 🧑‍💼 Why IT Professionals Should Understand This

As an IT support specialist or systems administrator, you may not write software, but you **interact with it constantly**:

- Installing and updating applications
- Troubleshooting software errors
- Understanding dependencies and failures
- Supporting developers or users

Knowing the basics of how software is built helps you:

- 🛠️ Fix issues more effectively
- 🔐 Understand system behaviors
- ⚙️ Improve communication with developers

## ✅ Summary

| Term         | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coding**   | Translating instructions into a computer-readable format               |
| **Scripting**| Writing short code to automate specific tasks                          |
| **Programming** | Creating complex software applications using full-featured languages |
| **Software** | The end result of coding/scripting/programming                         |

- Software powers everything from apps to servers
- Coding skills are becoming more accessible and essential
- IT pros must know how software functions, even if they don’t build it

> 🎯 Understanding software is foundational for **modern IT roles** — it’s how systems run, communicate, and evolve.
