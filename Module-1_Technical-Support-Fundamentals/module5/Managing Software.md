## 🧩 What Is Software?

The terms **program**, **application**, and **software** are often used interchangeably. For simplicity, we’ll refer to everything as **software**.

### 🛠️ Types of Software

| Type        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Drivers** | Allow the operating system to communicate with hardware (e.g., printers, keyboards) |
| **Applications** | Software used for daily tasks (e.g., Word processors, web browsers)         |
| **Utilities** | Tools that support system functions (e.g., calculator, settings, task manager)  |

## 🔁 Why Software Changes All the Time

Software evolves continuously:
- **Developers release updates** to fix bugs or improve features
- **Software companies change**, merge, or drop support for products
- **Compatibility issues** can arise with new operating systems or hardware

📉 This can create challenges:
- Updates might break compatibility with your systems (e.g., payroll software no longer working after an update)
- Old or unpatched software can expose you to **cybersecurity risks**

---

## 🛡️ Software Bugs & Security

A **software bug** is an error in a program that causes it to behave in unexpected or undesirable ways.

### Why This Matters:
- Bugs can be **exploited by attackers** to gain unauthorized access or damage systems
- **Outdated software** may have known vulnerabilities

### 🔄 Always Update Your Software

- Updates often include **security patches**, **bug fixes**, and **new features**
- Keeping software up to date is **critical for cybersecurity and performance**

## ⚙️ Software Management in IT

In an IT environment, software must be carefully **installed, updated, and removed** to ensure that systems remain functional and secure.

### 🔧 When Setting Up a Computer:
1. **Install** required software (e.g., web browser, office suite, job-specific tools)
2. **Remove** unnecessary or risky applications (e.g., games, unapproved utilities)
3. **Check source** of software to ensure it's **safe and reputable**

### ⚠️ Watch Out for Malicious Software

- Malicious software (malware) can:
  - Steal data
  - Slow down or crash systems
  - Spread across networks
- Always verify that software comes from a **trusted source**

---

## 🔐 Restricting Software Installation

Many workplaces use a security policy where **users cannot install software** on their own.

- Users are **prompted for administrator credentials** before installation
- This prevents:
  - Accidental installation of harmful or unnecessary apps
  - Clutter and performance issues
  - Breaches caused by unvetted software
