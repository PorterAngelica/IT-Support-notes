# 🐧 Installing, Updating, and Removing Software on Linux (Ubuntu)

This guide explains how to install, update, and remove software using the `apt` package manager in Ubuntu Linux.

---

## 📦 What is `apt`?

`apt` is Ubuntu’s **Advanced Package Tool** — a command-line tool used to install, update, and remove software packages.

---

## 🛠️ Installing Software

To install software on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install package-name
```

### 💡 Breakdown:
- `sudo` = Run the command with administrator (superuser) privileges.
- `apt` = The package manager command.
- `install` = Tells apt you want to install something.
- `package-name` = Replace with the name of the software (e.g., `git`).

#### ✅ Example:
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

If you get a **permission denied** error, it means you need to run the command with `sudo`.

When prompted with something like:

```
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
```

Press `Y` then `Enter`.

## 🔄 Updating Software

Before installing or upgrading packages, it’s good practice to update the package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

To update all installed software to the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

To update only a specific package:

```bash
sudo apt install --only-upgrade package-name
```

---

## 🔍 Searching for Software

Not sure about a package name? You can search for it:

```bash
apt search keyword
```

Example:
```bash
apt search git
```

---

## ❌ Removing Software

To remove software but keep its config files:

```bash
sudo apt remove package-name
```

To remove software *and* its configuration files:

```bash
sudo apt purge package-name
```

You’ll again be asked:

```
Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
```

Press `Y` and `Enter`.

## 🧠 Notes

- Always use `sudo` when installing, updating, or removing packages.
- `apt` is used in Debian-based distros like Ubuntu.  
  Other Linux distros use different tools:
  - Fedora: `dnf`
  - Arch: `pacman`
- You don’t usually need to restart the system after installing/removing software.
- When you see **"Permission denied"**, add `sudo` to the command.
